.SYNOPSIS
    Configures a fresh VMSS instance as a single-use (ephemeral) GitHub Actions runner.

.DESCRIPTION
    Executed on new instances by the runner-scale-up / runner-reconcile workflows through
    az vm run-command (no inbound ports, no secrets at rest -- the registration token is
    single use with a one hour expiry and is only ever passed as a parameter).

    The golden image pre-stages the runner at C:\github-runner, so this only has to:
      1. set the network profile to Private (appveyor.prep.ps1 runs Set-WSManQuickConfig,
         which refuses on Public profiles)
      2. register the runner as an ephemeral service running as SYSTEM

    The runner takes exactly one job; runner-reconcile deletes the instance afterwards,
    so every job starts on a factory-fresh VM, AppVeyor style.
