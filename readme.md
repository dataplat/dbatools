## Getting Started

<img align="left" src=bin/dbatools.png alt="dbatools logo">  dbatools is PowerShell module that you may think of like a command-line SQL Server Management Studio. The project initially started out as just `Start-SqlMigration.ps1`, but as of our 2.0 version release has grown into a collection of [nearly 700 commands](https://dbatools.io/commands) that help automate SQL Server tasks and encourage best practices.

## Installer

dbatools works on Windows, Linux and macOS (M1 and Intel!) ü§©üëç Windows requires PowerShell v3 and above, while those using dbatools on PowerShell Core will need to be running 7.4.0 and above.

Run the following command to install dbatools from the PowerShell Gallery (to install on a server or for all users, remove the `-Scope` parameter and run in an elevated session):

```powershell
Install-Module dbatools -Scope CurrentUser
```

If you use an earlier version of PowerShell that does not support the PowerShell Gallery, you can download `PowerShellGet` from [Microsoft's site](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/gallery/installing-psget?view=powershell-7.4) then run the command again.

## Usage scenarios

In addition to the simple things you can do in SSMS (e.g. starting a job, backing up a database), we've also read a whole bunch of docs and came up with commands that do nifty things quickly.

- Lost sysadmin access and need to regain entry to your SQL Server? Use [Reset-DbaAdmin](http://dbatools.io/Reset-DbaAdmin).
- Need to easily test your backups? Use [Test-DbaLastBackup](http://dbatools.io/Test-DbaLastBackup).
- SPN management got you down? Use [our suite of SPN commands](http://dbatools.io/schwifty) to find which SPNs are missing and easily add them.
- Got so many databases you can't keep track? Congrats on your big ol' environment! Use [Find-DbaDatabase](http://dbatools.io/Find-DbaDatabase) to easily find your database.

## Usage examples

As previously mentioned, dbatools now offers [over 700 commands](https://dbatools.io/commands)! [Here are some of the ones we highlight at conferences](https://gist.github.com/potatoqualitee/e8932b64aeb6ef404e252d656b6318a2).

PowerShell v3 and above required for Windows PowerShell, PowerShell Core 7.4.0+ required for cross-platform. (See below for important information about alternative logins and specifying SQL Server ports).

```powershell
# Set some vars
$new = "localhost\sql2016"
$old = $instance = "localhost"
$allservers = $old, $new

# Alternatively, use Registered Servers
$allservers = Get-DbaRegServer -SqlInstance $instance

# Need to restore a database? It can be as simple as this:
Restore-DbaDatabase -SqlInstance $instance -Path "C:\temp\AdventureWorks2012-Full Database Backup.bak"

# Use Ola Hallengren's backup script? We can restore an *ENTIRE INSTANCE* with just one line
Get-ChildItem -Directory \\workstation\backups\sql2012 | Restore-DbaDatabase -SqlInstance $new

# What about if you need to make a backup? And you are logging in with alternative credentials?
Get-DbaDatabase -SqlInstance $new -SqlCredential sqladmin | Backup-DbaDatabase

# Testing your backups is crazy easy!

## Important Note

#### Alternative SQL Credentials

By default, all SQL-based commands will login to SQL Server using Trusted/Windows Authentication. To use alternative credentials, including SQL Logins or alternative Windows credentials, use the `-SqlCredential`. This parameter accepts the results of `Get-Credential` which generates a [PSCredential](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-credential?view=powershell-5.1) object.

```powershell
Get-DbaDatabase -SqlInstance sql2017 -SqlCredential sqladmin
```

<a href="https://dbatools.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cred.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6897" src="https://dbatools.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cred.jpg" alt="" width="322" height="261" /></a>

A few (or maybe just one - [Restore-DbaDatabase](/Restore-DbaDatabase)), you can also use `-AzureCredential`.

#### Alternative Windows Credentials

For commands that access Windows such as [Get-DbaDiskSpace](/Get-DbaDiskSpace), you will pass the `-Credential` parameter.

```powershell
$cred = Get-Credential ad\winadmin
Get-DbaDiskSpace -ComputerName sql2017 -Credential $cred
```

To store credentials to disk, please read more at [Jaap Brasser's blog](https://www.jaapbrasser.com/quickly-and-securely-storing-your-credentials-powershell/).

#### Servers with custom ports

If you use non-default ports and SQL Browser is disabled, you can access servers using a colon (functionality we've added) or a comma (the way Microsoft does it).

```powershell
-SqlInstance sql2017:55559
-SqlInstance 'sql2017,55559'
```

Note that PowerShell sees commas as arrays, so you must surround the host name with quotes.

#### Using Start-Transcript

Due to an [issue](https://github.com/dataplat/dbatools/issues/2722) in the way PowerShell 5.1 works you need to use `Import-Module dbatools` before you run `Start-Transcript`. If this isn't done then your transcript will stop when the module is imported:

```powershell
Import-Module dbatools
Start-Transcript
Get-DbaDatabase -SqlInstance sql2017
Stop-Transcript
```
