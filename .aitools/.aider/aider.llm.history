SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.

SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python

SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.

SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.

SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.

SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.

USER Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
-------
ASSISTANT To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
ASSISTANT

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.

USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.

SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.

USER ````
USER # Pester v5 Test Standards
USER ## Objective
USER Transform PowerShell test files to comply with Pester v5 standards for the dbatools module. Maintain all existing functionality while enforcing consistent structure and style.
USER 
USER ## Core Requirements
USER 
USER ### Required Header
USER ```powershell
USER #Requires -Module @{ ModuleName="Pester"; ModuleVersion="5.0" }
USER param(
USER     $ModuleName  = "dbatools",
USER     $CommandName = "StaticCommandName",  # Always use static command name, never derive from file
USER     $PSDefaultParameterValues = $TestConfig.Defaults
USER )
USER ```
USER The `$CommandName` must always be a static string matching the command being tested.
USER 
USER ## Test Structure
USER 
USER ### Describe Blocks
USER - Use the `$CommandName` variable for Describe block names
USER - Include appropriate tags (`-Tag UnitTests` or `-Tag IntegrationTests`)
USER - **Never use `-ForEach` parameter on any test blocks**
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     # tests here
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Context Blocks
USER - Describe specific scenarios or states
USER - Use clear, descriptive names that explain the test scenario
USER - Example: "When getting all databases", "When database is offline"
USER 
USER ### Test Code Placement
USER - All setup code goes in `BeforeAll` or `BeforeEach` blocks
USER - All cleanup code goes in `AfterAll` or `AfterEach` blocks
USER - All test assertions go in `It` blocks
USER - No loose code in `Describe` or `Context` blocks
USER - Set and remove EnableException in BeforeAll/AfterAll for integration tests
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         $filesToRemove = @()
USER         # setup code here
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues.Remove('*-Dba*:EnableException')
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         Remove-Item -Path $filesToRemove -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When getting all databases" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $results = Get-DbaDatabase
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns results" {
USER             $results | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Style Guidelines
USER 
USER ### Formatting Rules
USER - Use double quotes for strings (we're a SQL Server module)
USER - Array declarations should be on multiple lines:
USER ```powershell
USER $array = @(
USER     "Item1",
USER     "Item2",
USER     "Item3"
USER )
USER ```
USER - Skip conditions must evaluate to `$true` or `$false`, not strings
USER - Use `$global:` instead of `$script:` for test configuration variables when required for Pester v5 scoping
USER - No trailing spaces
USER - Use `$results.Status.Count` for accurate counting
USER 
USER ### Where-Object Usage
USER Avoid script blocks in Where-Object when possible:
USER ```powershell
USER # Good - direct property comparison
USER $master    = $databases | Where-Object Name -eq "master"
USER $systemDbs = $databases | Where-Object Name -in "master", "model", "msdb", "tempdb"
USER 
USER # Required - script block for Parameters.Keys or filtering
USER $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Parameter & Variable Naming Rules
USER - Use direct parameters for 1-2 parameters
USER - Use `$splat<Purpose>` for 3+ parameters (never plain `$splat`)
USER - Align splat hashtable assignments with consistent spacing for readability
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER # Direct parameters
USER $ag = Get-DbaLogin -SqlInstance $instance -Login $loginName
USER 
USER # Splat with purpose suffix - note aligned = signs
USER $splatPrimary = @{
USER     Primary      = $TestConfig.instance3
USER     Name         = $primaryAgName
USER     ClusterType  = "None"
USER     FailoverMode = "Manual"
USER     Certificate  = "dbatoolsci_AGCert"
USER     Confirm      = $false
USER }
USER $primaryAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Unique Names Across Scopes
USER Use unique, descriptive variable names across scopes to avoid collisions. Pay particular attention to variable names in BeforeAll:
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $primaryAgName = "dbatoolsci_agroup"
USER         $splatPrimary = @{
USER             Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER             Name    = $primaryAgName
USER             ...
USER         }
USER         $ag = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When adding AG replicas" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $replicaAgName = "dbatoolsci_add_replicagroup"
USER             $splatRepAg = @{
USER                 Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER                 Name    = $replicaAgName
USER                 ...
USER             }
USER             $replicaAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatRepAg
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Temporary Files and Cleanup
USER 
USER - Create temporary test files/directories with unique names using Get-Random
USER - Always clean up temporary resources in AfterAll or AfterEach blocks
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         # Create unique temp path for this test run
USER         $backupPath = "$($TestConfig.Temp)\$CommandName-$(Get-Random)"
USER         $null = New-Item -Path $backupPath -ItemType Directory
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         # Always clean up temp files
USER         Remove-Item -Path $backupPath -Recurse
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When performing backups" {
USER         # test code here
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Test Implementation Examples
USER 
USER ### Good Parameter Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     Context "Parameter validation" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER             $expectedParameters = $TestConfig.CommonParameters
USER             $expectedParameters += @(
USER                 "SqlInstance",
USER                 "SqlCredential",
USER                 "Database",
USER                 "EnableException"
USER             )
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Should have the expected parameters" {
USER             Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $expectedParameters -DifferenceObject $hasParameters | Should -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Good Integration Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     Context "When connecting to SQL Server" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $allResults = @()
USER             foreach ($instance in $TestConfig.Instances) {
USER                 $allResults += Get-DbaDatabase -SqlInstance $instance
USER             }
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns database objects with required properties" {
USER             $allResults | Should -BeOfType Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Database
USER             $allResults[0].Name | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Always includes system databases" {
USER             $systemDbs = $allResults | Where-Object Name -in "master", "model", "msdb", "tempdb"
USER             $systemDbs.Count | Should -BeExactly 4
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Additional Requirements
USER 
USER ### Syntax Requirements
USER - Use $PSItem instead of $_ (except where $_ is required for compatibility)
USER - Match parameter names from original tests exactly
USER 
USER ### Must Use
USER - Static `$CommandName` parameter in param block
USER - The approach shown for parameter validation with filtering out WhatIf/Confirm
USER 
USER ### Must Not Use
USER - Dynamic command name derivation from file paths
USER - Old knownParameters validation approach
USER - Assumed parameter names - match original tests exactly
USER 
USER ## Critical Instruction
USER ALL comments must be preserved exactly as they appear in the original code, including seemingly unrelated or end-of-file comments. Even comments that appear to be development notes or temporary must be kept. This is especially important for comments related to CI/CD systems like AppVeyor.

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ````
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER IMPORTANT: Use *quadruple* backticks ```` as fences, not triple backticks!
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER Reply in English.
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

USER ````
USER # Pester v5 Test Standards
USER ## Objective
USER Transform PowerShell test files to comply with Pester v5 standards for the dbatools module. Maintain all existing functionality while enforcing consistent structure and style.
USER 
USER ## Core Requirements
USER 
USER ### Required Header
USER ```powershell
USER #Requires -Module @{ ModuleName="Pester"; ModuleVersion="5.0" }
USER param(
USER     $ModuleName  = "dbatools",
USER     $CommandName = "StaticCommandName",  # Always use static command name, never derive from file
USER     $PSDefaultParameterValues = $TestConfig.Defaults
USER )
USER ```
USER The `$CommandName` must always be a static string matching the command being tested.
USER 
USER ## Test Structure
USER 
USER ### Describe Blocks
USER - Use the `$CommandName` variable for Describe block names
USER - Include appropriate tags (`-Tag UnitTests` or `-Tag IntegrationTests`)
USER - **Never use `-ForEach` parameter on any test blocks**
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     # tests here
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Context Blocks
USER - Describe specific scenarios or states
USER - Use clear, descriptive names that explain the test scenario
USER - Example: "When getting all databases", "When database is offline"
USER 
USER ### Test Code Placement
USER - All setup code goes in `BeforeAll` or `BeforeEach` blocks
USER - All cleanup code goes in `AfterAll` or `AfterEach` blocks
USER - All test assertions go in `It` blocks
USER - No loose code in `Describe` or `Context` blocks
USER - Set and remove EnableException in BeforeAll/AfterAll for integration tests
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         $filesToRemove = @()
USER         # setup code here
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues.Remove('*-Dba*:EnableException')
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         Remove-Item -Path $filesToRemove -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When getting all databases" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $results = Get-DbaDatabase
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns results" {
USER             $results | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Style Guidelines
USER 
USER ### Formatting Rules
USER - Use double quotes for strings (we're a SQL Server module)
USER - Array declarations should be on multiple lines:
USER ```powershell
USER $array = @(
USER     "Item1",
USER     "Item2",
USER     "Item3"
USER )
USER ```
USER - Skip conditions must evaluate to `$true` or `$false`, not strings
USER - Use `$global:` instead of `$script:` for test configuration variables when required for Pester v5 scoping
USER - No trailing spaces
USER - Use `$results.Status.Count` for accurate counting
USER 
USER ### Where-Object Usage
USER Avoid script blocks in Where-Object when possible:
USER ```powershell
USER # Good - direct property comparison
USER $master    = $databases | Where-Object Name -eq "master"
USER $systemDbs = $databases | Where-Object Name -in "master", "model", "msdb", "tempdb"
USER 
USER # Required - script block for Parameters.Keys or filtering
USER $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Parameter & Variable Naming Rules
USER - Use direct parameters for 1-2 parameters
USER - Use `$splat<Purpose>` for 3+ parameters (never plain `$splat`)
USER - Align splat hashtable assignments with consistent spacing for readability
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER # Direct parameters
USER $ag = Get-DbaLogin -SqlInstance $instance -Login $loginName
USER 
USER # Splat with purpose suffix - note aligned = signs
USER $splatPrimary = @{
USER     Primary      = $TestConfig.instance3
USER     Name         = $primaryAgName
USER     ClusterType  = "None"
USER     FailoverMode = "Manual"
USER     Certificate  = "dbatoolsci_AGCert"
USER     Confirm      = $false
USER }
USER $primaryAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Unique Names Across Scopes
USER Use unique, descriptive variable names across scopes to avoid collisions. Pay particular attention to variable names in BeforeAll:
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $primaryAgName = "dbatoolsci_agroup"
USER         $splatPrimary = @{
USER             Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER             Name    = $primaryAgName
USER             ...
USER         }
USER         $ag = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When adding AG replicas" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $replicaAgName = "dbatoolsci_add_replicagroup"
USER             $splatRepAg = @{
USER                 Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER                 Name    = $replicaAgName
USER                 ...
USER             }
USER             $replicaAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatRepAg
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Temporary Files and Cleanup
USER 
USER - Create temporary test files/directories with unique names using Get-Random
USER - Always clean up temporary resources in AfterAll or AfterEach blocks
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         # Create unique temp path for this test run
USER         $backupPath = "$($TestConfig.Temp)\$CommandName-$(Get-Random)"
USER         $null = New-Item -Path $backupPath -ItemType Directory
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         # Always clean up temp files
USER         Remove-Item -Path $backupPath -Recurse
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When performing backups" {
USER         # test code here
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Test Implementation Examples
USER 
USER ### Good Parameter Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     Context "Parameter validation" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER             $expectedParameters = $TestConfig.CommonParameters
USER             $expectedParameters += @(
USER                 "SqlInstance",
USER                 "SqlCredential",
USER                 "Database",
USER                 "EnableException"
USER             )
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Should have the expected parameters" {
USER             Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $expectedParameters -DifferenceObject $hasParameters | Should -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Good Integration Test
USER ```powershell

USER         BeforeAll {

USER         }

USER 
USER ## Additional Requirements
USER 
USER ### Syntax Requirements
USER - Use $PSItem instead of $_ (except where $_ is required for compatibility)
USER - Match parameter names from original tests exactly
USER 
USER ### Must Use
USER - Static `$CommandName` parameter in param block
USER - The approach shown for parameter validation with filtering out WhatIf/Confirm
USER 
USER ### Must Not Use
USER - Dynamic command name derivation from file paths
USER - Old knownParameters validation approach
USER - Assumed parameter names - match original tests exactly
USER 
USER ## Critical Instruction
USER ALL comments must be preserved exactly as they appear in the original code, including seemingly unrelated or end-of-file comments. Even comments that appear to be development notes or temporary must be kept. This is especially important for comments related to CI/CD systems like AppVeyor.

USER You are an AI assistant created to help migrate Pester tests for the **dbatools PowerShell module** from version 4 to version 5. Analyze and update the file `/workspace/tests/Add-DbaAgDatabase.Tests.ps1` according to the instructions in conventions.md.
USER 
USER Command name:
USER Add-DbaAgDatabase
USER 
USER Parameters for this command:
USER SqlInstance
USER SqlCredential
USER AvailabilityGroup
USER Database
USER Secondary
USER SecondarySqlCredential

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ````
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER IMPORTANT: Use *quadruple* backticks ```` as fences, not triple backticks!
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER Reply in English.
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

ASSISTANT To migrate the Pester tests in `Add-DbaAgDatabase.Tests.ps1` from version 4 to version 5 according to the guidelines in `conventions.md`, I will make the following changes:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Update the `Describe` block to use the `$CommandName` variable.
ASSISTANT 2. Ensure that the `BeforeAll` and `AfterAll` blocks are structured correctly.
ASSISTANT 3. Replace the usage of `$_` with `$PSItem`.
ASSISTANT 4. Ensure that the comments are preserved as required.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for the necessary changes:

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.

USER I switched to a new code base. Please don't consider the above files or try to edit them any longer.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER Here are some READ ONLY files, provided for your reference.
USER Do not edit these files!
USER 
USER ../.aider/prompts/conventions.md
USER ````
USER # Pester v5 Test Standards
USER ## Objective
USER Transform PowerShell test files to comply with Pester v5 standards for the dbatools module. Maintain all existing functionality while enforcing consistent structure and style.
USER 
USER ## Core Requirements
USER 
USER ### Required Header
USER ```powershell
USER #Requires -Module @{ ModuleName="Pester"; ModuleVersion="5.0" }
USER param(
USER     $ModuleName  = "dbatools",
USER     $CommandName = "StaticCommandName",  # Always use static command name, never derive from file
USER     $PSDefaultParameterValues = $TestConfig.Defaults
USER )
USER ```
USER The `$CommandName` must always be a static string matching the command being tested.
USER 
USER ## Test Structure
USER 
USER ### Describe Blocks
USER - Use the `$CommandName` variable for Describe block names
USER - Include appropriate tags (`-Tag UnitTests` or `-Tag IntegrationTests`)
USER - **Never use `-ForEach` parameter on any test blocks**
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     # tests here
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Context Blocks
USER - Describe specific scenarios or states
USER - Use clear, descriptive names that explain the test scenario
USER - Example: "When getting all databases", "When database is offline"
USER 
USER ### Test Code Placement
USER - All setup code goes in `BeforeAll` or `BeforeEach` blocks
USER - All cleanup code goes in `AfterAll` or `AfterEach` blocks
USER - All test assertions go in `It` blocks
USER - No loose code in `Describe` or `Context` blocks
USER - Set and remove EnableException in BeforeAll/AfterAll for integration tests
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         $filesToRemove = @()
USER         # setup code here
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues.Remove('*-Dba*:EnableException')
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         Remove-Item -Path $filesToRemove -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When getting all databases" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $results = Get-DbaDatabase
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns results" {
USER             $results | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Style Guidelines
USER 
USER ### Formatting Rules
USER - Use double quotes for strings (we're a SQL Server module)
USER - Array declarations should be on multiple lines:
USER ```powershell
USER $array = @(
USER     "Item1",
USER     "Item2",
USER     "Item3"
USER )
USER ```
USER - Skip conditions must evaluate to `$true` or `$false`, not strings
USER - Use `$global:` instead of `$script:` for test configuration variables when required for Pester v5 scoping
USER - No trailing spaces
USER - Use `$results.Status.Count` for accurate counting
USER 
USER ### Where-Object Usage
USER Avoid script blocks in Where-Object when possible:
USER ```powershell
USER # Good - direct property comparison
USER $master    = $databases | Where-Object Name -eq "master"
USER $systemDbs = $databases | Where-Object Name -in "master", "model", "msdb", "tempdb"
USER 
USER # Required - script block for Parameters.Keys or filtering
USER $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Parameter & Variable Naming Rules
USER - Use direct parameters for 1-2 parameters
USER - Use `$splat<Purpose>` for 3+ parameters (never plain `$splat`)
USER - Align splat hashtable assignments with consistent spacing for readability
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER # Direct parameters
USER $ag = Get-DbaLogin -SqlInstance $instance -Login $loginName
USER 
USER # Splat with purpose suffix - note aligned = signs
USER $splatPrimary = @{
USER     Primary      = $TestConfig.instance3
USER     Name         = $primaryAgName
USER     ClusterType  = "None"
USER     FailoverMode = "Manual"
USER     Certificate  = "dbatoolsci_AGCert"
USER     Confirm      = $false
USER }
USER $primaryAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Unique Names Across Scopes
USER Use unique, descriptive variable names across scopes to avoid collisions. Pay particular attention to variable names in BeforeAll:
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $primaryAgName = "dbatoolsci_agroup"
USER         $splatPrimary = @{
USER             Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER             Name    = $primaryAgName
USER             ...
USER         }
USER         $ag = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When adding AG replicas" {

USER 
USER ### Temporary Files and Cleanup
USER 
USER - Create temporary test files/directories with unique names using Get-Random
USER - Always clean up temporary resources in AfterAll or AfterEach blocks
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         # Create unique temp path for this test run
USER         $backupPath = "$($TestConfig.Temp)\$CommandName-$(Get-Random)"
USER         $null = New-Item -Path $backupPath -ItemType Directory
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         # Always clean up temp files
USER         Remove-Item -Path $backupPath -Recurse
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When performing backups" {
USER         # test code here
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Test Implementation Examples
USER 
USER ### Good Parameter Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     Context "Parameter validation" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER             $expectedParameters = $TestConfig.CommonParameters
USER             $expectedParameters += @(
USER                 "SqlInstance",
USER                 "SqlCredential",
USER                 "Database",
USER                 "EnableException"

USER 
USER         It "Should have the expected parameters" {
USER             Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $expectedParameters -DifferenceObject $hasParameters | Should -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Good Integration Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     Context "When connecting to SQL Server" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $allResults = @()

USER             $systemDbs.Count | Should -BeExactly 4
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Additional Requirements
USER 
USER ### Syntax Requirements
USER - Use $PSItem instead of $_ (except where $_ is required for compatibility)
USER - Match parameter names from original tests exactly
USER 
USER ### Must Use
USER - Static `$CommandName` parameter in param block
USER - The approach shown for parameter validation with filtering out WhatIf/Confirm
USER 
USER ### Must Not Use
USER - Dynamic command name derivation from file paths
USER - Old knownParameters validation approach
USER - Assumed parameter names - match original tests exactly
USER 
USER ## Critical Instruction
USER ALL comments must be preserved exactly as they appear in the original code, including seemingly unrelated or end-of-file comments. Even comments that appear to be development notes or temporary must be kept. This is especially important for comments related to CI/CD systems like AppVeyor.

USER # Pester v4 to v5 Migration
USER 
USER You are an AI assistant created to help migrate Pester tests for the **dbatools PowerShell module** from version 4 to version 5. Analyze and update the file `/workspace/tests/Add-DbaAgListener.Tests.ps1` according to the instructions in conventions.md.
USER 
USER Command name:
USER Add-DbaAgListener
USER 
USER Parameters for this command:
USER SqlInstance
USER SqlCredential
USER AvailabilityGroup
USER Name
USER IPAddress
USER SubnetIP
USER SubnetMask

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ````
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER IMPORTANT: Use *quadruple* backticks ```` as fences, not triple backticks!
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER Reply in English.
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

ASSISTANT To migrate the `Add-DbaAgListener.Tests.ps1` file from Pester v4 to v5 according to the guidelines in `conventions.md`, I will make the following changes:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Ensure the `Describe` block uses the `$CommandName` variable.
ASSISTANT 2. Update the `Where-Object` usage to use `$PSItem` instead of `$_`.
ASSISTANT 3. Ensure that the `BeforeAll` and `AfterAll` blocks are structured correctly.
ASSISTANT 4. Maintain the required comments and structure as specified.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for the necessary changes:

ASSISTANT To migrate the Pester tests from version 4 to version 5 for the `Add-DbaAgListener` command, we need to make the following changes in the `Add-DbaAgListener.Tests.ps1` file:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Update the `Describe` and `It` blocks to use the new syntax.
ASSISTANT 2. Ensure that the `Compare-Object` assertion is updated to use `Should -Be` for parameter validation.
ASSISTANT 3. Remove any deprecated features or syntax that are no longer supported in Pester v5.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for the necessary changes:

SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer.
SYSTEM Always use best practices when coding.
SYSTEM Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.
SYSTEM Reply in English.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
SYSTEM If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Always reply to the user in English.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Once you understand the request you MUST:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep in mind these details about the user's platform and environment:

SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.

SYSTEM Reply in English.

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER Reply in English.
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

USER I switched to a new code base. Please don't consider the above files or try to edit them any longer.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER Here are some READ ONLY files, provided for your reference.
USER Do not edit these files!
USER 
USER ../.aider/prompts/conventions.md
USER ````
USER # Pester v5 Test Standards
USER ## Objective
USER Transform PowerShell test files to comply with Pester v5 standards for the dbatools module. Maintain all existing functionality while enforcing consistent structure and style.
USER 
USER ## Core Requirements
USER 
USER ### Required Header
USER ```powershell
USER #Requires -Module @{ ModuleName="Pester"; ModuleVersion="5.0" }
USER param(
USER     $ModuleName  = "dbatools",
USER     $CommandName = "StaticCommandName",  # Always use static command name, never derive from file
USER     $PSDefaultParameterValues = $TestConfig.Defaults
USER )
USER ```
USER The `$CommandName` must always be a static string matching the command being tested.
USER 
USER ## Test Structure
USER 
USER ### Describe Blocks
USER - Use the `$CommandName` variable for Describe block names
USER - Include appropriate tags (`-Tag UnitTests` or `-Tag IntegrationTests`)
USER - **Never use `-ForEach` parameter on any test blocks**
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     # tests here
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Context Blocks
USER - Describe specific scenarios or states
USER - Use clear, descriptive names that explain the test scenario
USER - Example: "When getting all databases", "When database is offline"
USER 
USER ### Test Code Placement
USER - All setup code goes in `BeforeAll` or `BeforeEach` blocks
USER - All cleanup code goes in `AfterAll` or `AfterEach` blocks
USER - All test assertions go in `It` blocks
USER - No loose code in `Describe` or `Context` blocks
USER - Set and remove EnableException in BeforeAll/AfterAll for integration tests
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         $filesToRemove = @()
USER         # setup code here
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues.Remove('*-Dba*:EnableException')
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         Remove-Item -Path $filesToRemove -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When getting all databases" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $results = Get-DbaDatabase
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns results" {
USER             $results | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Style Guidelines
USER 
USER ### Formatting Rules
USER - Use double quotes for strings (we're a SQL Server module)
USER - Array declarations should be on multiple lines:
USER ```powershell
USER $array = @(
USER     "Item1",
USER     "Item2",
USER     "Item3"
USER )
USER ```
USER - Skip conditions must evaluate to `$true` or `$false`, not strings
USER - Use `$global:` instead of `$script:` for test configuration variables when required for Pester v5 scoping
USER - No trailing spaces
USER - Use `$results.Status.Count` for accurate counting
USER 
USER ### Where-Object Usage
USER Avoid script blocks in Where-Object when possible:
USER ```powershell
USER # Good - direct property comparison
USER $master    = $databases | Where-Object Name -eq "master"
USER $systemDbs = $databases | Where-Object Name -in "master", "model", "msdb", "tempdb"
USER 
USER # Required - script block for Parameters.Keys or filtering
USER $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Parameter & Variable Naming Rules
USER - Use direct parameters for 1-2 parameters
USER - Use `$splat<Purpose>` for 3+ parameters (never plain `$splat`)
USER - Align splat hashtable assignments with consistent spacing for readability
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER # Direct parameters
USER $ag = Get-DbaLogin -SqlInstance $instance -Login $loginName
USER 
USER # Splat with purpose suffix - note aligned = signs
USER $splatPrimary = @{
USER     Primary      = $TestConfig.instance3
USER     Name         = $primaryAgName
USER     ClusterType  = "None"
USER     FailoverMode = "Manual"
USER     Certificate  = "dbatoolsci_AGCert"
USER     Confirm      = $false
USER }
USER $primaryAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Unique Names Across Scopes
USER Use unique, descriptive variable names across scopes to avoid collisions. Pay particular attention to variable names in BeforeAll:
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $primaryAgName = "dbatoolsci_agroup"
USER         $splatPrimary = @{
USER             Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER             Name    = $primaryAgName
USER             ...
USER         }
USER         $ag = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When adding AG replicas" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $replicaAgName = "dbatoolsci_add_replicagroup"
USER             $splatRepAg = @{
USER                 Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER                 Name    = $replicaAgName
USER                 ...
USER             }
USER             $replicaAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatRepAg
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Temporary Files and Cleanup
USER 
USER - Create temporary test files/directories with unique names using Get-Random
USER - Always clean up temporary resources in AfterAll or AfterEach blocks
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         # Create unique temp path for this test run
USER         $backupPath = "$($TestConfig.Temp)\$CommandName-$(Get-Random)"
USER         $null = New-Item -Path $backupPath -ItemType Directory
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         # Always clean up temp files
USER         Remove-Item -Path $backupPath -Recurse
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When performing backups" {
USER         # test code here
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Test Implementation Examples
USER 
USER ### Good Parameter Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     Context "Parameter validation" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER             $expectedParameters = $TestConfig.CommonParameters
USER             $expectedParameters += @(
USER                 "SqlInstance",
USER                 "SqlCredential",
USER                 "Database",
USER                 "EnableException"
USER             )
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Should have the expected parameters" {
USER             Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $expectedParameters -DifferenceObject $hasParameters | Should -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Good Integration Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     Context "When connecting to SQL Server" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $allResults = @()
USER             foreach ($instance in $TestConfig.Instances) {
USER                 $allResults += Get-DbaDatabase -SqlInstance $instance
USER             }
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns database objects with required properties" {
USER             $allResults | Should -BeOfType Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Database
USER             $allResults[0].Name | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Always includes system databases" {
USER             $systemDbs = $allResults | Where-Object Name -in "master", "model", "msdb", "tempdb"
USER             $systemDbs.Count | Should -BeExactly 4
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Additional Requirements
USER 
USER ### Syntax Requirements
USER - Use $PSItem instead of $_ (except where $_ is required for compatibility)
USER - Match parameter names from original tests exactly
USER 
USER ### Must Use
USER - Static `$CommandName` parameter in param block
USER - The approach shown for parameter validation with filtering out WhatIf/Confirm
USER 
USER ### Must Not Use
USER - Dynamic command name derivation from file paths
USER - Old knownParameters validation approach
USER - Assumed parameter names - match original tests exactly
USER 
USER ## Critical Instruction
USER ALL comments must be preserved exactly as they appear in the original code, including seemingly unrelated or end-of-file comments. Even comments that appear to be development notes or temporary must be kept. This is especially important for comments related to CI/CD systems like AppVeyor.

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ````
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER IMPORTANT: Use *quadruple* backticks ```` as fences, not triple backticks!
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER Reply in English.
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

USER Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
-------
ASSISTANT To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Import the math package.
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
ASSISTANT 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT mathweb/flask/app.py
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT from flask import Flask
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT import math
ASSISTANT from flask import Flask
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```

USER Refactor hello() into its own file.
-------
ASSISTANT To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
ASSISTANT 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT hello.py
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT def hello():
ASSISTANT     "print a greeting"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     print("hello")
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE

USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

USER Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
-------
ASSISTANT To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Import the math package.
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
ASSISTANT 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT mathweb/flask/app.py
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT from flask import Flask

USER Refactor hello() into its own file.
-------
ASSISTANT To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
ASSISTANT 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT hello.py
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT def hello():
ASSISTANT     "print a greeting"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     print("hello")

SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer.
SYSTEM Always use best practices when coding.
SYSTEM Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.
SYSTEM Reply in English.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
SYSTEM If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Always reply to the user in English.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Once you understand the request you MUST:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep in mind these details about the user's platform and environment:
SYSTEM - Platform: Linux-6.6.87.2-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35

SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM IMPORTANT: Use *quadruple* backticks ```` as fences, not triple backticks!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.

-------
ASSISTANT Ok.

USER Here are some READ ONLY files, provided for your reference.
USER Do not edit these files!

USER ../.aider/prompts/conventions.md
USER ````
USER # Pester v5 Test Standards
USER ## Objective
USER Transform PowerShell test files to comply with Pester v5 standards for the dbatools module. Maintain all existing functionality while enforcing consistent structure and style.
USER 
USER ## Core Requirements
USER 
USER ### Required Header
USER ```powershell
USER #Requires -Module @{ ModuleName="Pester"; ModuleVersion="5.0" }
USER param(
USER     $ModuleName  = "dbatools",
USER     $CommandName = "StaticCommandName",  # Always use static command name, never derive from file
USER     $PSDefaultParameterValues = $TestConfig.Defaults
USER )
USER ```
USER The `$CommandName` must always be a static string matching the command being tested.
USER 
USER ## Test Structure
USER 
USER ### Describe Blocks
USER - Use the `$CommandName` variable for Describe block names
USER - Include appropriate tags (`-Tag UnitTests` or `-Tag IntegrationTests`)
USER - **Never use `-ForEach` parameter on any test blocks**
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     # tests here
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Context Blocks
USER - Describe specific scenarios or states
USER - Use clear, descriptive names that explain the test scenario
USER - Example: "When getting all databases", "When database is offline"
USER 
USER ### Test Code Placement
USER - All setup code goes in `BeforeAll` or `BeforeEach` blocks
USER - All cleanup code goes in `AfterAll` or `AfterEach` blocks
USER - All test assertions go in `It` blocks
USER - No loose code in `Describe` or `Context` blocks
USER - Set and remove EnableException in BeforeAll/AfterAll for integration tests
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         $filesToRemove = @()
USER         # setup code here
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues.Remove('*-Dba*:EnableException')
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         Remove-Item -Path $filesToRemove -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When getting all databases" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $results = Get-DbaDatabase
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns results" {
USER             $results | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Style Guidelines
USER 
USER ### Formatting Rules
USER - Use double quotes for strings (we're a SQL Server module)
USER - Array declarations should be on multiple lines:
USER ```powershell
USER $array = @(
USER     "Item1",
USER     "Item2",
USER     "Item3"
USER )
USER ```
USER - Skip conditions must evaluate to `$true` or `$false`, not strings
USER - Use `$global:` instead of `$script:` for test configuration variables when required for Pester v5 scoping
USER - No trailing spaces
USER - Use `$results.Status.Count` for accurate counting
USER 
USER ### Where-Object Usage
USER Avoid script blocks in Where-Object when possible:
USER ```powershell
USER # Good - direct property comparison
USER $master    = $databases | Where-Object Name -eq "master"
USER $systemDbs = $databases | Where-Object Name -in "master", "model", "msdb", "tempdb"
USER 
USER # Required - script block for Parameters.Keys or filtering
USER $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Parameter & Variable Naming Rules
USER - Use direct parameters for 1-2 parameters
USER - Use `$splat<Purpose>` for 3+ parameters (never plain `$splat`)
USER - Align splat hashtable assignments with consistent spacing for readability
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER # Direct parameters
USER $ag = Get-DbaLogin -SqlInstance $instance -Login $loginName
USER 
USER # Splat with purpose suffix - note aligned = signs
USER $splatPrimary = @{
USER     Primary      = $TestConfig.instance3
USER     Name         = $primaryAgName
USER     ClusterType  = "None"
USER     FailoverMode = "Manual"
USER     Certificate  = "dbatoolsci_AGCert"
USER     Confirm      = $false
USER }
USER $primaryAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Unique Names Across Scopes
USER Use unique, descriptive variable names across scopes to avoid collisions. Pay particular attention to variable names in BeforeAll:
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $primaryAgName = "dbatoolsci_agroup"
USER         $splatPrimary = @{
USER             Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER             Name    = $primaryAgName
USER             ...
USER         }
USER         $ag = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When adding AG replicas" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $replicaAgName = "dbatoolsci_add_replicagroup"
USER             $splatRepAg = @{
USER                 Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER                 Name    = $replicaAgName
USER                 ...
USER             }
USER             $replicaAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatRepAg
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Temporary Files and Cleanup
USER 
USER - Create temporary test files/directories with unique names using Get-Random
USER - Always clean up temporary resources in AfterAll or AfterEach blocks
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         # Create unique temp path for this test run
USER         $backupPath = "$($TestConfig.Temp)\$CommandName-$(Get-Random)"
USER         $null = New-Item -Path $backupPath -ItemType Directory
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         # Always clean up temp files
USER         Remove-Item -Path $backupPath -Recurse
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When performing backups" {
USER         # test code here
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Test Implementation Examples
USER 
USER ### Good Parameter Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     Context "Parameter validation" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER             $expectedParameters = $TestConfig.CommonParameters
USER             $expectedParameters += @(
USER                 "SqlInstance",
USER                 "SqlCredential",
USER                 "Database",
USER                 "EnableException"
USER             )
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Should have the expected parameters" {
USER             Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $expectedParameters -DifferenceObject $hasParameters | Should -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Good Integration Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     Context "When connecting to SQL Server" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $allResults = @()
USER             foreach ($instance in $TestConfig.Instances) {
USER                 $allResults += Get-DbaDatabase -SqlInstance $instance
USER             }
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns database objects with required properties" {
USER             $allResults | Should -BeOfType Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Database
USER             $allResults[0].Name | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Always includes system databases" {
USER             $systemDbs = $allResults | Where-Object Name -in "master", "model", "msdb", "tempdb"
USER             $systemDbs.Count | Should -BeExactly 4
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Additional Requirements
USER 
USER ### Syntax Requirements
USER - Use $PSItem instead of $_ (except where $_ is required for compatibility)
USER - Match parameter names from original tests exactly
USER 
USER ### Must Use
USER - Static `$CommandName` parameter in param block
USER - The approach shown for parameter validation with filtering out WhatIf/Confirm
USER 
USER ### Must Not Use
USER - Dynamic command name derivation from file paths
USER - Old knownParameters validation approach
USER - Assumed parameter names - match original tests exactly
USER 
USER ## Critical Instruction
USER ALL comments must be preserved exactly as they appear in the original code, including seemingly unrelated or end-of-file comments. Even comments that appear to be development notes or temporary must be kept. This is especially important for comments related to CI/CD systems like AppVeyor.

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ````
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER IMPORTANT: Use *quadruple* backticks ```` as fences, not triple backticks!
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER Reply in English.
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

-------
ASSISTANT To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.

USER 
USER Delete all unused variable assignments identified above. Remove the entire line for each unused variable. Make no other changes to the code that are not included in this fix list.
USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER Reply in English.
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM IMPORTANT: Use *quadruple* backticks ```` as fences, not triple backticks!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Reply in English.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

USER # Pester v5 Test Standards
USER ## Objective
USER Transform PowerShell test files to comply with Pester v5 standards for the dbatools module. Maintain all existing functionality while enforcing consistent structure and style.
USER 
USER ## Core Requirements
USER 
USER ### Required Header
USER ```powershell
USER #Requires -Module @{ ModuleName="Pester"; ModuleVersion="5.0" }
USER param(
USER     $ModuleName  = "dbatools",
USER     $CommandName = "StaticCommandName",  # Always use static command name, never derive from file
USER     $PSDefaultParameterValues = $TestConfig.Defaults
USER )
USER ```
USER The `$CommandName` must always be a static string matching the command being tested.
USER 
USER ## Test Structure
USER 
USER ### Describe Blocks
USER - Use the `$CommandName` variable for Describe block names
USER - Include appropriate tags (`-Tag UnitTests` or `-Tag IntegrationTests`)
USER - **Never use `-ForEach` parameter on any test blocks**
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     # tests here
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Context Blocks
USER - Describe specific scenarios or states
USER - Use clear, descriptive names that explain the test scenario
USER - Example: "When getting all databases", "When database is offline"
USER 
USER ### Test Code Placement
USER - All setup code goes in `BeforeAll` or `BeforeEach` blocks
USER - All cleanup code goes in `AfterAll` or `AfterEach` blocks
USER - All test assertions go in `It` blocks
USER - No loose code in `Describe` or `Context` blocks
USER - Set and remove EnableException in BeforeAll/AfterAll for integration tests
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         $filesToRemove = @()
USER         # setup code here
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues.Remove('*-Dba*:EnableException')
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         Remove-Item -Path $filesToRemove -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When getting all databases" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $results = Get-DbaDatabase
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns results" {
USER             $results | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Style Guidelines
USER 
USER ### Formatting Rules
USER - Use double quotes for strings (we're a SQL Server module)
USER - Array declarations should be on multiple lines:
USER ```powershell
USER $array = @(
USER     "Item1",
USER     "Item2",
USER     "Item3"
USER )
USER ```
USER - Skip conditions must evaluate to `$true` or `$false`, not strings
USER - Use `$global:` instead of `$script:` for test configuration variables when required for Pester v5 scoping
USER - No trailing spaces
USER - Use `$results.Status.Count` for accurate counting
USER 
USER ### Where-Object Usage
USER Avoid script blocks in Where-Object when possible:
USER ```powershell
USER # Good - direct property comparison
USER $master    = $databases | Where-Object Name -eq "master"
USER $systemDbs = $databases | Where-Object Name -in "master", "model", "msdb", "tempdb"
USER 
USER # Required - script block for Parameters.Keys or filtering
USER $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Parameter & Variable Naming Rules
USER - Use direct parameters for 1-2 parameters
USER - Use `$splat<Purpose>` for 3+ parameters (never plain `$splat`)
USER - Align splat hashtable assignments with consistent spacing for readability
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER # Direct parameters
USER $ag = Get-DbaLogin -SqlInstance $instance -Login $loginName
USER 
USER # Splat with purpose suffix - note aligned = signs
USER $splatPrimary = @{
USER     Primary      = $TestConfig.instance3
USER     Name         = $primaryAgName
USER     ClusterType  = "None"
USER     FailoverMode = "Manual"
USER     Certificate  = "dbatoolsci_AGCert"
USER     Confirm      = $false
USER }
USER $primaryAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Unique Names Across Scopes
USER Use unique, descriptive variable names across scopes to avoid collisions. Pay particular attention to variable names in BeforeAll:
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $primaryAgName = "dbatoolsci_agroup"
USER         $splatPrimary = @{
USER             Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER             Name    = $primaryAgName
USER             ...
USER         }
USER         $ag = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When adding AG replicas" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $replicaAgName = "dbatoolsci_add_replicagroup"
USER             $splatRepAg = @{
USER                 Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER                 Name    = $replicaAgName
USER                 ...
USER             }
USER             $replicaAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatRepAg
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Temporary Files and Cleanup
USER 
USER - Create temporary test files/directories with unique names using Get-Random
USER - Always clean up temporary resources in AfterAll or AfterEach blocks
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         # Create unique temp path for this test run
USER         $backupPath = "$($TestConfig.Temp)\$CommandName-$(Get-Random)"
USER         $null = New-Item -Path $backupPath -ItemType Directory
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         # Always clean up temp files
USER         Remove-Item -Path $backupPath -Recurse
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When performing backups" {
USER         # test code here
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Test Implementation Examples
USER 
USER ### Good Parameter Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     Context "Parameter validation" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER             $expectedParameters = $TestConfig.CommonParameters
USER             $expectedParameters += @(
USER                 "SqlInstance",
USER                 "SqlCredential",
USER                 "Database",
USER                 "EnableException"
USER             )
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Should have the expected parameters" {
USER             Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $expectedParameters -DifferenceObject $hasParameters | Should -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Good Integration Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     Context "When connecting to SQL Server" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $allResults = @()
USER             foreach ($instance in $TestConfig.Instances) {
USER                 $allResults += Get-DbaDatabase -SqlInstance $instance
USER             }
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns database objects with required properties" {
USER             $allResults | Should -BeOfType Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Database
USER             $allResults[0].Name | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Always includes system databases" {
USER             $systemDbs = $allResults | Where-Object Name -in "master", "model", "msdb", "tempdb"
USER             $systemDbs.Count | Should -BeExactly 4
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Additional Requirements
USER 
USER ### Syntax Requirements
USER - Use $PSItem instead of $_ (except where $_ is required for compatibility)
USER - Match parameter names from original tests exactly
USER 
USER ### Must Use
USER - Static `$CommandName` parameter in param block
USER - The approach shown for parameter validation with filtering out WhatIf/Confirm
USER 
USER ### Must Not Use
USER - Dynamic command name derivation from file paths
USER - Old knownParameters validation approach
USER - Assumed parameter names - match original tests exactly
USER 
USER ## Critical Instruction
USER ALL comments must be preserved exactly as they appear in the original code, including seemingly unrelated or end-of-file comments. Even comments that appear to be development notes or temporary must be kept. This is especially important for comments related to CI/CD systems like AppVeyor.

-------
ASSISTANT To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
ASSISTANT 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
ASSISTANT

USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER Reply in English.
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.

USER Reply in English.

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.

USER Here are some READ ONLY files, provided for your reference.
USER Do not edit these files!

USER ../.aider/prompts/conventions.md

USER # Pester v5 Test Standards
USER ## Objective
USER Transform PowerShell test files to comply with Pester v5 standards for the dbatools module. Maintain all existing functionality while enforcing consistent structure and style.
USER 
USER ## Core Requirements
USER 
USER ### Required Header
USER ```powershell
USER #Requires -Module @{ ModuleName="Pester"; ModuleVersion="5.0" }
USER param(
USER     $ModuleName  = "dbatools",
USER     $CommandName = "StaticCommandName",  # Always use static command name, never derive from file
USER     $PSDefaultParameterValues = $TestConfig.Defaults
USER )
USER ```
USER The `$CommandName` must always be a static string matching the command being tested.
USER 
USER ## Test Structure
USER 
USER ### Describe Blocks
USER - Use the `$CommandName` variable for Describe block names
USER - Include appropriate tags (`-Tag UnitTests` or `-Tag IntegrationTests`)
USER - **Never use `-ForEach` parameter on any test blocks**
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     # tests here
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Context Blocks
USER - Describe specific scenarios or states
USER - Use clear, descriptive names that explain the test scenario
USER - Example: "When getting all databases", "When database is offline"
USER 
USER ### Test Code Placement
USER - All setup code goes in `BeforeAll` or `BeforeEach` blocks
USER - All cleanup code goes in `AfterAll` or `AfterEach` blocks
USER - All test assertions go in `It` blocks
USER - No loose code in `Describe` or `Context` blocks
USER - Set and remove EnableException in BeforeAll/AfterAll for integration tests
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         $filesToRemove = @()
USER         # setup code here
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues.Remove('*-Dba*:EnableException')
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         Remove-Item -Path $filesToRemove -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When getting all databases" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $results = Get-DbaDatabase
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns results" {
USER             $results | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Style Guidelines
USER 
USER ### Formatting Rules
USER - Use double quotes for strings (we're a SQL Server module)
USER - Array declarations should be on multiple lines:
USER ```powershell
USER $array = @(
USER     "Item1",
USER     "Item2",
USER     "Item3"
USER )
USER ```
USER - Skip conditions must evaluate to `$true` or `$false`, not strings
USER - Use `$global:` instead of `$script:` for test configuration variables when required for Pester v5 scoping
USER - No trailing spaces
USER - Use `$results.Status.Count` for accurate counting
USER 
USER ### Where-Object Usage
USER Avoid script blocks in Where-Object when possible:
USER ```powershell
USER # Good - direct property comparison
USER $master    = $databases | Where-Object Name -eq "master"
USER $systemDbs = $databases | Where-Object Name -in "master", "model", "msdb", "tempdb"
USER 
USER # Required - script block for Parameters.Keys or filtering
USER $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Parameter & Variable Naming Rules
USER - Use direct parameters for 1-2 parameters
USER - Use `$splat<Purpose>` for 3+ parameters (never plain `$splat`)
USER - Align splat hashtable assignments with consistent spacing for readability
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER # Direct parameters
USER $ag = Get-DbaLogin -SqlInstance $instance -Login $loginName
USER 
USER # Splat with purpose suffix - note aligned = signs
USER $splatPrimary = @{
USER     Primary      = $TestConfig.instance3
USER     Name         = $primaryAgName
USER     ClusterType  = "None"
USER     FailoverMode = "Manual"
USER     Certificate  = "dbatoolsci_AGCert"
USER     Confirm      = $false
USER }
USER $primaryAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Unique Names Across Scopes
USER Use unique, descriptive variable names across scopes to avoid collisions. Pay particular attention to variable names in BeforeAll:
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $primaryAgName = "dbatoolsci_agroup"
USER         $splatPrimary = @{
USER             Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER             Name    = $primaryAgName
USER             ...
USER         }
USER         $ag = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When adding AG replicas" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $replicaAgName = "dbatoolsci_add_replicagroup"
USER             $splatRepAg = @{
USER                 Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER                 Name    = $replicaAgName
USER                 ...
USER             }
USER             $replicaAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatRepAg
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Temporary Files and Cleanup
USER 
USER - Create temporary test files/directories with unique names using Get-Random
USER - Always clean up temporary resources in AfterAll or AfterEach blocks
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         # Create unique temp path for this test run
USER         $backupPath = "$($TestConfig.Temp)\$CommandName-$(Get-Random)"
USER         $null = New-Item -Path $backupPath -ItemType Directory
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         # Always clean up temp files
USER         Remove-Item -Path $backupPath -Recurse
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When performing backups" {
USER         # test code here
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Test Implementation Examples
USER 
USER ### Good Parameter Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     Context "Parameter validation" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER             $expectedParameters = $TestConfig.CommonParameters
USER             $expectedParameters += @(
USER                 "SqlInstance",
USER                 "SqlCredential",
USER                 "Database",
USER                 "EnableException"
USER             )
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Should have the expected parameters" {
USER             Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $expectedParameters -DifferenceObject $hasParameters | Should -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Good Integration Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     Context "When connecting to SQL Server" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $allResults = @()
USER             foreach ($instance in $TestConfig.Instances) {
USER                 $allResults += Get-DbaDatabase -SqlInstance $instance
USER             }
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns database objects with required properties" {
USER             $allResults | Should -BeOfType Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Database
USER             $allResults[0].Name | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Always includes system databases" {
USER             $systemDbs = $allResults | Where-Object Name -in "master", "model", "msdb", "tempdb"
USER             $systemDbs.Count | Should -BeExactly 4
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Additional Requirements
USER 
USER ### Syntax Requirements
USER - Use $PSItem instead of $_ (except where $_ is required for compatibility)
USER - Match parameter names from original tests exactly
USER 
USER ### Must Use
USER - Static `$CommandName` parameter in param block
USER - The approach shown for parameter validation with filtering out WhatIf/Confirm
USER 
USER ### Must Not Use
USER - Dynamic command name derivation from file paths
USER - Old knownParameters validation approach
USER - Assumed parameter names - match original tests exactly
USER 
USER ## Critical Instruction
USER ALL comments must be preserved exactly as they appear in the original code, including seemingly unrelated or end-of-file comments. Even comments that appear to be development notes or temporary must be kept. This is especially important for comments related to CI/CD systems like AppVeyor.

SYSTEM Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.
SYSTEM Reply in English.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
SYSTEM If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Always reply to the user in English.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Once you understand the request you MUST:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep in mind these details about the user's platform and environment:
SYSTEM - Platform: Linux-6.6.87.2-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35

SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM IMPORTANT: Use *quadruple* backticks ```` as fences, not triple backticks!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Reply in English.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

USER ../.aider/prompts/conventions.md
USER ````
USER # Pester v5 Test Standards
USER ## Objective
USER Transform PowerShell test files to comply with Pester v5 standards for the dbatools module. Maintain all existing functionality while enforcing consistent structure and style.
USER 
USER ## Core Requirements
USER 
USER ### Required Header
USER ```powershell
USER #Requires -Module @{ ModuleName="Pester"; ModuleVersion="5.0" }
USER param(
USER     $ModuleName  = "dbatools",
USER     $CommandName = "StaticCommandName",  # Always use static command name, never derive from file
USER     $PSDefaultParameterValues = $TestConfig.Defaults
USER )
USER ```
USER The `$CommandName` must always be a static string matching the command being tested.
USER 
USER ## Test Structure
USER 
USER ### Describe Blocks
USER - Use the `$CommandName` variable for Describe block names
USER - Include appropriate tags (`-Tag UnitTests` or `-Tag IntegrationTests`)
USER - **Never use `-ForEach` parameter on any test blocks**
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     # tests here
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Context Blocks
USER - Describe specific scenarios or states
USER - Use clear, descriptive names that explain the test scenario
USER - Example: "When getting all databases", "When database is offline"
USER 
USER ### Test Code Placement
USER - All setup code goes in `BeforeAll` or `BeforeEach` blocks
USER - All cleanup code goes in `AfterAll` or `AfterEach` blocks
USER - All test assertions go in `It` blocks
USER - No loose code in `Describe` or `Context` blocks
USER - Set and remove EnableException in BeforeAll/AfterAll for integration tests
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         $filesToRemove = @()
USER         # setup code here
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues.Remove('*-Dba*:EnableException')
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         Remove-Item -Path $filesToRemove -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When getting all databases" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $results = Get-DbaDatabase
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns results" {
USER             $results | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Style Guidelines
USER 
USER ### Formatting Rules
USER - Use double quotes for strings (we're a SQL Server module)
USER - Array declarations should be on multiple lines:
USER ```powershell
USER $array = @(
USER     "Item1",
USER     "Item2",
USER     "Item3"
USER )
USER ```
USER - Skip conditions must evaluate to `$true` or `$false`, not strings
USER - Use `$global:` instead of `$script:` for test configuration variables when required for Pester v5 scoping
USER - No trailing spaces
USER - Use `$results.Status.Count` for accurate counting
USER 
USER ### Where-Object Usage
USER Avoid script blocks in Where-Object when possible:
USER ```powershell
USER # Good - direct property comparison
USER $master    = $databases | Where-Object Name -eq "master"
USER $systemDbs = $databases | Where-Object Name -in "master", "model", "msdb", "tempdb"
USER 
USER # Required - script block for Parameters.Keys or filtering
USER $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Parameter & Variable Naming Rules
USER - Use direct parameters for 1-2 parameters
USER - Use `$splat<Purpose>` for 3+ parameters (never plain `$splat`)
USER - Align splat hashtable assignments with consistent spacing for readability
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER # Direct parameters
USER $ag = Get-DbaLogin -SqlInstance $instance -Login $loginName
USER 
USER # Splat with purpose suffix - note aligned = signs
USER $splatPrimary = @{
USER     Primary      = $TestConfig.instance3
USER     Name         = $primaryAgName
USER     ClusterType  = "None"
USER     FailoverMode = "Manual"
USER     Certificate  = "dbatoolsci_AGCert"
USER     Confirm      = $false
USER }
USER $primaryAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Unique Names Across Scopes
USER Use unique, descriptive variable names across scopes to avoid collisions. Pay particular attention to variable names in BeforeAll:
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $primaryAgName = "dbatoolsci_agroup"
USER         $splatPrimary = @{
USER             Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER             Name    = $primaryAgName
USER             ...
USER         }
USER         $ag = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When adding AG replicas" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $replicaAgName = "dbatoolsci_add_replicagroup"
USER             $splatRepAg = @{
USER                 Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER                 Name    = $replicaAgName
USER                 ...
USER             }
USER             $replicaAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatRepAg
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Temporary Files and Cleanup
USER 
USER - Create temporary test files/directories with unique names using Get-Random
USER - Always clean up temporary resources in AfterAll or AfterEach blocks
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         # Create unique temp path for this test run
USER         $backupPath = "$($TestConfig.Temp)\$CommandName-$(Get-Random)"
USER         $null = New-Item -Path $backupPath -ItemType Directory
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         # Always clean up temp files
USER         Remove-Item -Path $backupPath -Recurse
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When performing backups" {
USER         # test code here
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Test Implementation Examples
USER 
USER ### Good Parameter Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     Context "Parameter validation" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER             $expectedParameters = $TestConfig.CommonParameters
USER             $expectedParameters += @(
USER                 "SqlInstance",
USER                 "SqlCredential",
USER                 "Database",
USER                 "EnableException"
USER             )
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Should have the expected parameters" {
USER             Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $expectedParameters -DifferenceObject $hasParameters | Should -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Good Integration Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     Context "When connecting to SQL Server" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $allResults = @()
USER             foreach ($instance in $TestConfig.Instances) {
USER                 $allResults += Get-DbaDatabase -SqlInstance $instance
USER             }
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns database objects with required properties" {
USER             $allResults | Should -BeOfType Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Database
USER             $allResults[0].Name | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Always includes system databases" {
USER             $systemDbs = $allResults | Where-Object Name -in "master", "model", "msdb", "tempdb"
USER             $systemDbs.Count | Should -BeExactly 4
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Additional Requirements
USER 
USER ### Syntax Requirements
USER - Use $PSItem instead of $_ (except where $_ is required for compatibility)
USER - Match parameter names from original tests exactly
USER 
USER ### Must Use
USER - Static `$CommandName` parameter in param block
USER - The approach shown for parameter validation with filtering out WhatIf/Confirm
USER 
USER ### Must Not Use
USER - Dynamic command name derivation from file paths
USER - Old knownParameters validation approach
USER - Assumed parameter names - match original tests exactly
USER 
USER ## Critical Instruction
USER ALL comments must be preserved exactly as they appear in the original code, including seemingly unrelated or end-of-file comments. Even comments that appear to be development notes or temporary must be kept. This is especially important for comments related to CI/CD systems like AppVeyor.

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ````
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER IMPORTANT: Use *quadruple* backticks ```` as fences, not triple backticks!
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER Reply in English.
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

USER # Pester v5 Test Standards
USER ## Objective
USER Transform PowerShell test files to comply with Pester v5 standards for the dbatools module. Maintain all existing functionality while enforcing consistent structure and style.
USER 
USER ## Core Requirements
USER 
USER ### Required Header
USER ```powershell
USER #Requires -Module @{ ModuleName="Pester"; ModuleVersion="5.0" }
USER param(
USER     $ModuleName  = "dbatools",
USER     $CommandName = "StaticCommandName",  # Always use static command name, never derive from file
USER     $PSDefaultParameterValues = $TestConfig.Defaults
USER )
USER ```
USER The `$CommandName` must always be a static string matching the command being tested.
USER 
USER ## Test Structure
USER 
USER ### Describe Blocks
USER - Use the `$CommandName` variable for Describe block names
USER - Include appropriate tags (`-Tag UnitTests` or `-Tag IntegrationTests`)
USER - **Never use `-ForEach` parameter on any test blocks**
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     # tests here
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Context Blocks
USER - Describe specific scenarios or states
USER - Use clear, descriptive names that explain the test scenario
USER - Example: "When getting all databases", "When database is offline"
USER 
USER ### Test Code Placement
USER - All setup code goes in `BeforeAll` or `BeforeEach` blocks
USER - All cleanup code goes in `AfterAll` or `AfterEach` blocks
USER - All test assertions go in `It` blocks
USER - No loose code in `Describe` or `Context` blocks
USER - Set and remove EnableException in BeforeAll/AfterAll for integration tests
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         $filesToRemove = @()
USER         # setup code here
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues.Remove('*-Dba*:EnableException')
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         Remove-Item -Path $filesToRemove -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When getting all databases" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $results = Get-DbaDatabase
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns results" {
USER             $results | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Style Guidelines
USER 
USER ### Formatting Rules
USER - Use double quotes for strings (we're a SQL Server module)
USER - Array declarations should be on multiple lines:
USER ```powershell
USER $array = @(
USER     "Item1",
USER     "Item2",
USER     "Item3"
USER )
USER ```
USER - Skip conditions must evaluate to `$true` or `$false`, not strings
USER - Use `$global:` instead of `$script:` for test configuration variables when required for Pester v5 scoping
USER - No trailing spaces
USER - Use `$results.Status.Count` for accurate counting
USER 
USER ### Where-Object Usage
USER Avoid script blocks in Where-Object when possible:
USER ```powershell
USER # Good - direct property comparison
USER $master    = $databases | Where-Object Name -eq "master"
USER $systemDbs = $databases | Where-Object Name -in "master", "model", "msdb", "tempdb"
USER 
USER # Required - script block for Parameters.Keys or filtering
USER $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Parameter & Variable Naming Rules
USER - Use direct parameters for 1-2 parameters
USER - Use `$splat<Purpose>` for 3+ parameters (never plain `$splat`)
USER - Align splat hashtable assignments with consistent spacing for readability
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER # Direct parameters
USER $ag = Get-DbaLogin -SqlInstance $instance -Login $loginName
USER 
USER # Splat with purpose suffix - note aligned = signs
USER $splatPrimary = @{
USER     Primary      = $TestConfig.instance3
USER     Name         = $primaryAgName
USER     ClusterType  = "None"
USER     FailoverMode = "Manual"
USER     Certificate  = "dbatoolsci_AGCert"
USER     Confirm      = $false
USER }
USER $primaryAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Unique Names Across Scopes
USER Use unique, descriptive variable names across scopes to avoid collisions. Pay particular attention to variable names in BeforeAll:
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $primaryAgName = "dbatoolsci_agroup"
USER         $splatPrimary = @{
USER             Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER             Name    = $primaryAgName
USER             ...
USER         }
USER         $ag = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When adding AG replicas" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $replicaAgName = "dbatoolsci_add_replicagroup"
USER             $splatRepAg = @{
USER                 Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER                 Name    = $replicaAgName
USER                 ...
USER             }
USER             $replicaAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatRepAg
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Temporary Files and Cleanup
USER 
USER - Create temporary test files/directories with unique names using Get-Random
USER - Always clean up temporary resources in AfterAll or AfterEach blocks
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         # Create unique temp path for this test run
USER         $backupPath = "$($TestConfig.Temp)\$CommandName-$(Get-Random)"
USER         $null = New-Item -Path $backupPath -ItemType Directory
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         # Always clean up temp files
USER         Remove-Item -Path $backupPath -Recurse
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When performing backups" {
USER         # test code here
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Test Implementation Examples
USER 
USER ### Good Parameter Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     Context "Parameter validation" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER             $expectedParameters = $TestConfig.CommonParameters
USER             $expectedParameters += @(
USER                 "SqlInstance",
USER                 "SqlCredential",
USER                 "Database",
USER                 "EnableException"
USER             )
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Should have the expected parameters" {
USER             Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $expectedParameters -DifferenceObject $hasParameters | Should -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Good Integration Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     Context "When connecting to SQL Server" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $allResults = @()
USER             foreach ($instance in $TestConfig.Instances) {
USER                 $allResults += Get-DbaDatabase -SqlInstance $instance
USER             }
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns database objects with required properties" {
USER             $allResults | Should -BeOfType Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Database
USER             $allResults[0].Name | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Always includes system databases" {
USER             $systemDbs = $allResults | Where-Object Name -in "master", "model", "msdb", "tempdb"
USER             $systemDbs.Count | Should -BeExactly 4
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Additional Requirements
USER 
USER ### Syntax Requirements
USER - Use $PSItem instead of $_ (except where $_ is required for compatibility)
USER - Match parameter names from original tests exactly
USER 
USER ### Must Use
USER - Static `$CommandName` parameter in param block
USER - The approach shown for parameter validation with filtering out WhatIf/Confirm
USER 
USER ### Must Not Use
USER - Dynamic command name derivation from file paths
USER - Old knownParameters validation approach
USER - Assumed parameter names - match original tests exactly
USER 
USER ## Critical Instruction
USER ALL comments must be preserved exactly as they appear in the original code, including seemingly unrelated or end-of-file comments. Even comments that appear to be development notes or temporary must be kept. This is especially important for comments related to CI/CD systems like AppVeyor.

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ````
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER IMPORTANT: Use *quadruple* backticks ```` as fences, not triple backticks!
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER Reply in English.
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER Reply in English.
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER Reply in English.
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

USER I switched to a new code base. Please don't consider the above files or try to edit them any longer.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER Here are some READ ONLY files, provided for your reference.
USER Do not edit these files!
USER 
USER ../.aider/prompts/conventions.md
USER ````
USER # Pester v5 Test Standards
USER ## Objective
USER Transform PowerShell test files to comply with Pester v5 standards for the dbatools module. Maintain all existing functionality while enforcing consistent structure and style.
USER 
USER ## Core Requirements
USER 
USER ### Required Header
USER ```powershell
USER #Requires -Module @{ ModuleName="Pester"; ModuleVersion="5.0" }
USER param(
USER     $ModuleName  = "dbatools",
USER     $CommandName = "StaticCommandName",  # Always use static command name, never derive from file
USER     $PSDefaultParameterValues = $TestConfig.Defaults
USER )
USER ```
USER The `$CommandName` must always be a static string matching the command being tested.
USER 
USER ## Test Structure
USER 
USER ### Describe Blocks
USER - Use the `$CommandName` variable for Describe block names
USER - Include appropriate tags (`-Tag UnitTests` or `-Tag IntegrationTests`)
USER - **Never use `-ForEach` parameter on any test blocks**
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     # tests here
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Context Blocks
USER - Describe specific scenarios or states
USER - Use clear, descriptive names that explain the test scenario
USER - Example: "When getting all databases", "When database is offline"
USER 
USER ### Test Code Placement
USER - All setup code goes in `BeforeAll` or `BeforeEach` blocks
USER - All cleanup code goes in `AfterAll` or `AfterEach` blocks
USER - All test assertions go in `It` blocks
USER - No loose code in `Describe` or `Context` blocks
USER - Set and remove EnableException in BeforeAll/AfterAll for integration tests
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         $filesToRemove = @()
USER         # setup code here
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues.Remove('*-Dba*:EnableException')
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         Remove-Item -Path $filesToRemove -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When getting all databases" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $results = Get-DbaDatabase
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns results" {
USER             $results | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Style Guidelines
USER 
USER ### Formatting Rules
USER - Use double quotes for strings (we're a SQL Server module)
USER - Array declarations should be on multiple lines:
USER ```powershell
USER $array = @(
USER     "Item1",
USER     "Item2",
USER     "Item3"
USER )
USER ```
USER - Skip conditions must evaluate to `$true` or `$false`, not strings
USER - Use `$global:` instead of `$script:` for test configuration variables when required for Pester v5 scoping
USER - No trailing spaces
USER - Use `$results.Status.Count` for accurate counting
USER 
USER ### Where-Object Usage
USER Avoid script blocks in Where-Object when possible:
USER ```powershell
USER # Good - direct property comparison
USER $master    = $databases | Where-Object Name -eq "master"
USER $systemDbs = $databases | Where-Object Name -in "master", "model", "msdb", "tempdb"
USER 
USER # Required - script block for Parameters.Keys or filtering
USER $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Parameter & Variable Naming Rules
USER - Use direct parameters for 1-2 parameters
USER - Use `$splat<Purpose>` for 3+ parameters (never plain `$splat`)
USER - Align splat hashtable assignments with consistent spacing for readability
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER # Direct parameters
USER $ag = Get-DbaLogin -SqlInstance $instance -Login $loginName
USER 
USER # Splat with purpose suffix - note aligned = signs
USER $splatPrimary = @{
USER     Primary      = $TestConfig.instance3
USER     Name         = $primaryAgName
USER     ClusterType  = "None"
USER     FailoverMode = "Manual"
USER     Certificate  = "dbatoolsci_AGCert"
USER     Confirm      = $false
USER }
USER $primaryAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Unique Names Across Scopes
USER Use unique, descriptive variable names across scopes to avoid collisions. Pay particular attention to variable names in BeforeAll:
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $primaryAgName = "dbatoolsci_agroup"
USER         $splatPrimary = @{
USER             Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER             Name    = $primaryAgName
USER             ...
USER         }
USER         $ag = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When adding AG replicas" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $replicaAgName = "dbatoolsci_add_replicagroup"
USER             $splatRepAg = @{
USER                 Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER                 Name    = $replicaAgName
USER                 ...
USER             }
USER             $replicaAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatRepAg
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Temporary Files and Cleanup
USER 
USER - Create temporary test files/directories with unique names using Get-Random
USER - Always clean up temporary resources in AfterAll or AfterEach blocks
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         # Create unique temp path for this test run
USER         $backupPath = "$($TestConfig.Temp)\$CommandName-$(Get-Random)"
USER         $null = New-Item -Path $backupPath -ItemType Directory
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         # Always clean up temp files
USER         Remove-Item -Path $backupPath -Recurse
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When performing backups" {
USER         # test code here
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Test Implementation Examples
USER 
USER ### Good Parameter Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     Context "Parameter validation" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER             $expectedParameters = $TestConfig.CommonParameters
USER             $expectedParameters += @(
USER                 "SqlInstance",
USER                 "SqlCredential",
USER                 "Database",
USER                 "EnableException"
USER             )
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Should have the expected parameters" {
USER             Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $expectedParameters -DifferenceObject $hasParameters | Should -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Good Integration Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     Context "When connecting to SQL Server" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $allResults = @()
USER             foreach ($instance in $TestConfig.Instances) {
USER                 $allResults += Get-DbaDatabase -SqlInstance $instance
USER             }
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns database objects with required properties" {
USER             $allResults | Should -BeOfType Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Database
USER             $allResults[0].Name | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }

USER 
USER ## Additional Requirements
USER 
USER ### Syntax Requirements
USER - Use $PSItem instead of $_ (except where $_ is required for compatibility)
USER - Match parameter names from original tests exactly
USER 
USER ### Must Use
USER - Static `$CommandName` parameter in param block
USER - The approach shown for parameter validation with filtering out WhatIf/Confirm
USER 
USER ### Must Not Use
USER - Dynamic command name derivation from file paths
USER - Old knownParameters validation approach
USER - Assumed parameter names - match original tests exactly
USER 
USER ## Critical Instruction
USER ALL comments must be preserved exactly as they appear in the original code, including seemingly unrelated or end-of-file comments. Even comments that appear to be development notes or temporary must be kept. This is especially important for comments related to CI/CD systems like AppVeyor.

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ````
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER IMPORTANT: Use *quadruple* backticks ```` as fences, not triple backticks!
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER Reply in English.
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.

USER ../.aider/prompts/conventions.md
USER ````
USER # Pester v5 Test Standards
USER ## Objective
USER Transform PowerShell test files to comply with Pester v5 standards for the dbatools module. Maintain all existing functionality while enforcing consistent structure and style.
USER 
USER ## Core Requirements
USER 
USER ### Required Header
USER ```powershell
USER #Requires -Module @{ ModuleName="Pester"; ModuleVersion="5.0" }
USER param(
USER     $ModuleName  = "dbatools",
USER     $CommandName = "StaticCommandName",  # Always use static command name, never derive from file
USER     $PSDefaultParameterValues = $TestConfig.Defaults
USER )
USER ```
USER The `$CommandName` must always be a static string matching the command being tested.
USER 
USER ## Test Structure
USER 
USER ### Describe Blocks
USER - Use the `$CommandName` variable for Describe block names
USER - Include appropriate tags (`-Tag UnitTests` or `-Tag IntegrationTests`)
USER - **Never use `-ForEach` parameter on any test blocks**
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     # tests here
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Context Blocks
USER - Describe specific scenarios or states
USER - Use clear, descriptive names that explain the test scenario
USER - Example: "When getting all databases", "When database is offline"
USER 
USER ### Test Code Placement
USER - All setup code goes in `BeforeAll` or `BeforeEach` blocks
USER - All cleanup code goes in `AfterAll` or `AfterEach` blocks
USER - All test assertions go in `It` blocks
USER - No loose code in `Describe` or `Context` blocks
USER - Set and remove EnableException in BeforeAll/AfterAll for integration tests
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         $filesToRemove = @()
USER         # setup code here
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues.Remove('*-Dba*:EnableException')
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         Remove-Item -Path $filesToRemove -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When getting all databases" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $results = Get-DbaDatabase
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns results" {
USER             $results | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Style Guidelines
USER 
USER ### Formatting Rules
USER - Use double quotes for strings (we're a SQL Server module)
USER - Array declarations should be on multiple lines:
USER ```powershell
USER $array = @(
USER     "Item1",
USER     "Item2",
USER     "Item3"
USER )
USER ```
USER - Skip conditions must evaluate to `$true` or `$false`, not strings
USER - Use `$global:` instead of `$script:` for test configuration variables when required for Pester v5 scoping
USER - No trailing spaces
USER - Use `$results.Status.Count` for accurate counting
USER 
USER ### Where-Object Usage
USER Avoid script blocks in Where-Object when possible:
USER ```powershell
USER # Good - direct property comparison
USER $master    = $databases | Where-Object Name -eq "master"
USER $systemDbs = $databases | Where-Object Name -in "master", "model", "msdb", "tempdb"
USER 
USER # Required - script block for Parameters.Keys or filtering
USER $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Parameter & Variable Naming Rules
USER - Use direct parameters for 1-2 parameters
USER - Use `$splat<Purpose>` for 3+ parameters (never plain `$splat`)
USER - Align splat hashtable assignments with consistent spacing for readability
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER # Direct parameters
USER $ag = Get-DbaLogin -SqlInstance $instance -Login $loginName
USER 
USER # Splat with purpose suffix - note aligned = signs
USER $splatPrimary = @{
USER     Primary      = $TestConfig.instance3
USER     Name         = $primaryAgName
USER     ClusterType  = "None"
USER     FailoverMode = "Manual"
USER     Certificate  = "dbatoolsci_AGCert"
USER     Confirm      = $false
USER }
USER $primaryAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Unique Names Across Scopes
USER Use unique, descriptive variable names across scopes to avoid collisions. Pay particular attention to variable names in BeforeAll:
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $primaryAgName = "dbatoolsci_agroup"
USER         $splatPrimary = @{
USER             Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER             Name    = $primaryAgName
USER             ...
USER         }
USER         $ag = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When adding AG replicas" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $replicaAgName = "dbatoolsci_add_replicagroup"
USER             $splatRepAg = @{
USER                 Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER                 Name    = $replicaAgName
USER                 ...
USER             }
USER             $replicaAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatRepAg
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Temporary Files and Cleanup
USER 
USER - Create temporary test files/directories with unique names using Get-Random
USER - Always clean up temporary resources in AfterAll or AfterEach blocks
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         # Create unique temp path for this test run
USER         $backupPath = "$($TestConfig.Temp)\$CommandName-$(Get-Random)"
USER         $null = New-Item -Path $backupPath -ItemType Directory
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         # Always clean up temp files
USER         Remove-Item -Path $backupPath -Recurse
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When performing backups" {
USER         # test code here
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Test Implementation Examples
USER 
USER ### Good Parameter Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     Context "Parameter validation" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER             $expectedParameters = $TestConfig.CommonParameters
USER             $expectedParameters += @(
USER                 "SqlInstance",
USER                 "SqlCredential",
USER                 "Database",
USER                 "EnableException"
USER             )
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Should have the expected parameters" {
USER             Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $expectedParameters -DifferenceObject $hasParameters | Should -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Good Integration Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     Context "When connecting to SQL Server" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $allResults = @()
USER             foreach ($instance in $TestConfig.Instances) {
USER                 $allResults += Get-DbaDatabase -SqlInstance $instance
USER             }
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns database objects with required properties" {
USER             $allResults | Should -BeOfType Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Database
USER             $allResults[0].Name | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Always includes system databases" {
USER             $systemDbs = $allResults | Where-Object Name -in "master", "model", "msdb", "tempdb"
USER             $systemDbs.Count | Should -BeExactly 4
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Additional Requirements
USER 
USER ### Syntax Requirements
USER - Use $PSItem instead of $_ (except where $_ is required for compatibility)
USER - Match parameter names from original tests exactly
USER 
USER ### Must Use
USER - Static `$CommandName` parameter in param block
USER - The approach shown for parameter validation with filtering out WhatIf/Confirm
USER 
USER ### Must Not Use
USER - Dynamic command name derivation from file paths
USER - Old knownParameters validation approach
USER - Assumed parameter names - match original tests exactly
USER 
USER ## Critical Instruction
USER ALL comments must be preserved exactly as they appear in the original code, including seemingly unrelated or end-of-file comments. Even comments that appear to be development notes or temporary must be kept. This is especially important for comments related to CI/CD systems like AppVeyor.

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ````
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER IMPORTANT: Use *quadruple* backticks ```` as fences, not triple backticks!
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER Reply in English.
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER Reply in English.

USER Here are some READ ONLY files, provided for your reference.
USER Do not edit these files!
USER 
USER ../.aider/prompts/conventions.md
USER ````
USER # Pester v5 Test Standards
USER ## Objective
USER Transform PowerShell test files to comply with Pester v5 standards for the dbatools module. Maintain all existing functionality while enforcing consistent structure and style.
USER 
USER ## Core Requirements
USER 
USER ### Required Header
USER ```powershell
USER #Requires -Module @{ ModuleName="Pester"; ModuleVersion="5.0" }
USER param(
USER     $ModuleName  = "dbatools",
USER     $CommandName = "StaticCommandName",  # Always use static command name, never derive from file
USER     $PSDefaultParameterValues = $TestConfig.Defaults
USER )
USER ```
USER The `$CommandName` must always be a static string matching the command being tested.
USER 
USER ## Test Structure
USER 
USER ### Describe Blocks
USER - Use the `$CommandName` variable for Describe block names
USER - Include appropriate tags (`-Tag UnitTests` or `-Tag IntegrationTests`)
USER - **Never use `-ForEach` parameter on any test blocks**
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     # tests here
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Context Blocks
USER - Describe specific scenarios or states
USER - Use clear, descriptive names that explain the test scenario
USER - Example: "When getting all databases", "When database is offline"
USER 
USER ### Test Code Placement
USER - All setup code goes in `BeforeAll` or `BeforeEach` blocks
USER - All cleanup code goes in `AfterAll` or `AfterEach` blocks
USER - All test assertions go in `It` blocks
USER - No loose code in `Describe` or `Context` blocks
USER - Set and remove EnableException in BeforeAll/AfterAll for integration tests
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         $filesToRemove = @()
USER         # setup code here
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues.Remove('*-Dba*:EnableException')
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         Remove-Item -Path $filesToRemove -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When getting all databases" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $results = Get-DbaDatabase
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns results" {
USER             $results | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Style Guidelines
USER 
USER ### Formatting Rules
USER - Use double quotes for strings (we're a SQL Server module)
USER - Array declarations should be on multiple lines:
USER ```powershell
USER $array = @(
USER     "Item1",
USER     "Item2",
USER     "Item3"
USER )
USER ```
USER - Skip conditions must evaluate to `$true` or `$false`, not strings
USER - Use `$global:` instead of `$script:` for test configuration variables when required for Pester v5 scoping
USER - No trailing spaces
USER - Use `$results.Status.Count` for accurate counting
USER 
USER ### Where-Object Usage
USER Avoid script blocks in Where-Object when possible:
USER ```powershell
USER # Good - direct property comparison
USER $master    = $databases | Where-Object Name -eq "master"
USER $systemDbs = $databases | Where-Object Name -in "master", "model", "msdb", "tempdb"
USER 
USER # Required - script block for Parameters.Keys or filtering
USER $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Parameter & Variable Naming Rules
USER - Use direct parameters for 1-2 parameters
USER - Use `$splat<Purpose>` for 3+ parameters (never plain `$splat`)
USER - Align splat hashtable assignments with consistent spacing for readability
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER # Direct parameters
USER $ag = Get-DbaLogin -SqlInstance $instance -Login $loginName
USER 
USER # Splat with purpose suffix - note aligned = signs
USER $splatPrimary = @{
USER     Primary      = $TestConfig.instance3
USER     Name         = $primaryAgName
USER     ClusterType  = "None"
USER     FailoverMode = "Manual"
USER     Certificate  = "dbatoolsci_AGCert"
USER     Confirm      = $false
USER }
USER $primaryAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Unique Names Across Scopes
USER Use unique, descriptive variable names across scopes to avoid collisions. Pay particular attention to variable names in BeforeAll:
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $primaryAgName = "dbatoolsci_agroup"
USER         $splatPrimary = @{
USER             Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER             Name    = $primaryAgName
USER             ...
USER         }
USER         $ag = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When adding AG replicas" {
USER         BeforeAll {

USER ### Temporary Files and Cleanup
USER 
USER - Create temporary test files/directories with unique names using Get-Random
USER - Always clean up temporary resources in AfterAll or AfterEach blocks
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         # Create unique temp path for this test run
USER         $backupPath = "$($TestConfig.Temp)\$CommandName-$(Get-Random)"
USER         $null = New-Item -Path $backupPath -ItemType Directory
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         # Always clean up temp files
USER         Remove-Item -Path $backupPath -Recurse
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When performing backups" {
USER         # test code here
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Test Implementation Examples
USER 
USER ### Good Parameter Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     Context "Parameter validation" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER             $expectedParameters = $TestConfig.CommonParameters
USER             $expectedParameters += @(
USER                 "SqlInstance",
USER                 "SqlCredential",
USER                 "Database",
USER                 "EnableException"
USER             )
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Should have the expected parameters" {
USER             Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $expectedParameters -DifferenceObject $hasParameters | Should -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Good Integration Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     Context "When connecting to SQL Server" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $allResults = @()
USER             foreach ($instance in $TestConfig.Instances) {
USER                 $allResults += Get-DbaDatabase -SqlInstance $instance
USER             }
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns database objects with required properties" {
USER             $allResults | Should -BeOfType Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Database

USER             $systemDbs = $allResults | Where-Object Name -in "master", "model", "msdb", "tempdb"
USER             $systemDbs.Count | Should -BeExactly 4
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Additional Requirements
USER 
USER ### Syntax Requirements
USER - Use $PSItem instead of $_ (except where $_ is required for compatibility)
USER - Match parameter names from original tests exactly
USER 
USER ### Must Use
USER - Static `$CommandName` parameter in param block
USER - The approach shown for parameter validation with filtering out WhatIf/Confirm
USER 
USER ### Must Not Use
USER - Dynamic command name derivation from file paths
USER - Old knownParameters validation approach
USER - Assumed parameter names - match original tests exactly
USER 
USER ## Critical Instruction
USER ALL comments must be preserved exactly as they appear in the original code, including seemingly unrelated or end-of-file comments. Even comments that appear to be development notes or temporary must be kept. This is especially important for comments related to CI/CD systems like AppVeyor.

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ````
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER IMPORTANT: Use *quadruple* backticks ```` as fences, not triple backticks!
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER Reply in English.
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER Reply in English.
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

USER # Pester v5 Test Standards
USER ## Objective
USER Transform PowerShell test files to comply with Pester v5 standards for the dbatools module. Maintain all existing functionality while enforcing consistent structure and style.
USER 
USER ## Core Requirements
USER 
USER ### Required Header
USER ```powershell
USER #Requires -Module @{ ModuleName="Pester"; ModuleVersion="5.0" }
USER param(
USER     $ModuleName  = "dbatools",
USER     $CommandName = "StaticCommandName",  # Always use static command name, never derive from file
USER     $PSDefaultParameterValues = $TestConfig.Defaults
USER )
USER ```
USER The `$CommandName` must always be a static string matching the command being tested.
USER 
USER ## Test Structure
USER 
USER ### Describe Blocks
USER - Use the `$CommandName` variable for Describe block names
USER - Include appropriate tags (`-Tag UnitTests` or `-Tag IntegrationTests`)
USER - **Never use `-ForEach` parameter on any test blocks**
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     # tests here
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Context Blocks
USER - Describe specific scenarios or states
USER - Use clear, descriptive names that explain the test scenario
USER - Example: "When getting all databases", "When database is offline"
USER 
USER ### Test Code Placement
USER - All setup code goes in `BeforeAll` or `BeforeEach` blocks
USER - All cleanup code goes in `AfterAll` or `AfterEach` blocks
USER - All test assertions go in `It` blocks
USER - No loose code in `Describe` or `Context` blocks
USER - Set and remove EnableException in BeforeAll/AfterAll for integration tests
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         $filesToRemove = @()
USER         # setup code here
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues.Remove('*-Dba*:EnableException')
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         Remove-Item -Path $filesToRemove -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When getting all databases" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $results = Get-DbaDatabase
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns results" {
USER             $results | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Style Guidelines
USER 
USER ### Formatting Rules
USER - Use double quotes for strings (we're a SQL Server module)
USER - Array declarations should be on multiple lines:
USER ```powershell
USER $array = @(
USER     "Item1",
USER     "Item2",
USER     "Item3"
USER )
USER ```
USER - Skip conditions must evaluate to `$true` or `$false`, not strings
USER - Use `$global:` instead of `$script:` for test configuration variables when required for Pester v5 scoping
USER - No trailing spaces
USER - Use `$results.Status.Count` for accurate counting
USER 
USER ### Where-Object Usage
USER Avoid script blocks in Where-Object when possible:
USER ```powershell
USER # Good - direct property comparison
USER $master    = $databases | Where-Object Name -eq "master"
USER $systemDbs = $databases | Where-Object Name -in "master", "model", "msdb", "tempdb"
USER 
USER # Required - script block for Parameters.Keys or filtering
USER $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Parameter & Variable Naming Rules
USER - Use direct parameters for 1-2 parameters
USER - Use `$splat<Purpose>` for 3+ parameters (never plain `$splat`)
USER - Align splat hashtable assignments with consistent spacing for readability
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER # Direct parameters
USER $ag = Get-DbaLogin -SqlInstance $instance -Login $loginName
USER 
USER # Splat with purpose suffix - note aligned = signs
USER $splatPrimary = @{
USER     Primary      = $TestConfig.instance3
USER     Name         = $primaryAgName
USER     ClusterType  = "None"
USER     FailoverMode = "Manual"
USER     Certificate  = "dbatoolsci_AGCert"
USER     Confirm      = $false
USER }
USER $primaryAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Unique Names Across Scopes
USER Use unique, descriptive variable names across scopes to avoid collisions. Pay particular attention to variable names in BeforeAll:
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $primaryAgName = "dbatoolsci_agroup"
USER         $splatPrimary = @{
USER             Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER             Name    = $primaryAgName
USER             ...
USER         }
USER         $ag = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When adding AG replicas" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $replicaAgName = "dbatoolsci_add_replicagroup"
USER             $splatRepAg = @{
USER                 Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER                 Name    = $replicaAgName
USER                 ...
USER             }
USER             $replicaAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatRepAg
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Temporary Files and Cleanup
USER 
USER - Create temporary test files/directories with unique names using Get-Random
USER - Always clean up temporary resources in AfterAll or AfterEach blocks
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         # Create unique temp path for this test run
USER         $backupPath = "$($TestConfig.Temp)\$CommandName-$(Get-Random)"
USER         $null = New-Item -Path $backupPath -ItemType Directory
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         # Always clean up temp files
USER         Remove-Item -Path $backupPath -Recurse
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When performing backups" {
USER         # test code here
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Test Implementation Examples
USER 
USER ### Good Parameter Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     Context "Parameter validation" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER             $expectedParameters = $TestConfig.CommonParameters
USER             $expectedParameters += @(
USER                 "SqlInstance",
USER                 "SqlCredential",
USER                 "Database",
USER                 "EnableException"
USER             )
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Should have the expected parameters" {
USER             Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $expectedParameters -DifferenceObject $hasParameters | Should -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Good Integration Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     Context "When connecting to SQL Server" {

USER 
USER ## Additional Requirements
USER 
USER ### Syntax Requirements
USER - Use $PSItem instead of $_ (except where $_ is required for compatibility)
USER - Match parameter names from original tests exactly
USER 
USER ### Must Use
USER - Static `$CommandName` parameter in param block
USER - The approach shown for parameter validation with filtering out WhatIf/Confirm
USER 
USER ### Must Not Use
USER - Dynamic command name derivation from file paths
USER - Old knownParameters validation approach
USER - Assumed parameter names - match original tests exactly
USER 
USER ## Critical Instruction
USER ALL comments must be preserved exactly as they appear in the original code, including seemingly unrelated or end-of-file comments. Even comments that appear to be development notes or temporary must be kept. This is especially important for comments related to CI/CD systems like AppVeyor.

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ````
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER IMPORTANT: Use *quadruple* backticks ```` as fences, not triple backticks!
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER Reply in English.

USER # Pester v5 Test Standards
USER ## Objective
USER Transform PowerShell test files to comply with Pester v5 standards for the dbatools module. Maintain all existing functionality while enforcing consistent structure and style.
USER 
USER ## Core Requirements
USER 
USER ### Required Header
USER ```powershell
USER #Requires -Module @{ ModuleName="Pester"; ModuleVersion="5.0" }
USER param(
USER     $ModuleName  = "dbatools",
USER     $CommandName = "StaticCommandName",  # Always use static command name, never derive from file
USER     $PSDefaultParameterValues = $TestConfig.Defaults
USER )
USER ```
USER The `$CommandName` must always be a static string matching the command being tested.
USER 
USER ## Test Structure
USER 
USER ### Describe Blocks
USER - Use the `$CommandName` variable for Describe block names
USER - Include appropriate tags (`-Tag UnitTests` or `-Tag IntegrationTests`)
USER - **Never use `-ForEach` parameter on any test blocks**
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     # tests here
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Context Blocks
USER - Describe specific scenarios or states
USER - Use clear, descriptive names that explain the test scenario
USER - Example: "When getting all databases", "When database is offline"
USER 
USER ### Test Code Placement
USER - All setup code goes in `BeforeAll` or `BeforeEach` blocks
USER - All cleanup code goes in `AfterAll` or `AfterEach` blocks
USER - All test assertions go in `It` blocks
USER - No loose code in `Describe` or `Context` blocks
USER - Set and remove EnableException in BeforeAll/AfterAll for integration tests
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         $filesToRemove = @()
USER         # setup code here
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues.Remove('*-Dba*:EnableException')
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         Remove-Item -Path $filesToRemove -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When getting all databases" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $results = Get-DbaDatabase
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns results" {
USER             $results | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Style Guidelines
USER 
USER ### Formatting Rules
USER - Use double quotes for strings (we're a SQL Server module)
USER - Array declarations should be on multiple lines:
USER ```powershell
USER $array = @(
USER     "Item1",
USER     "Item2",
USER     "Item3"
USER )
USER ```
USER - Skip conditions must evaluate to `$true` or `$false`, not strings
USER - Use `$global:` instead of `$script:` for test configuration variables when required for Pester v5 scoping
USER - No trailing spaces
USER - Use `$results.Status.Count` for accurate counting
USER 
USER ### Where-Object Usage
USER Avoid script blocks in Where-Object when possible:
USER ```powershell
USER # Good - direct property comparison
USER $master    = $databases | Where-Object Name -eq "master"
USER $systemDbs = $databases | Where-Object Name -in "master", "model", "msdb", "tempdb"
USER 
USER # Required - script block for Parameters.Keys or filtering
USER $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Parameter & Variable Naming Rules
USER - Use direct parameters for 1-2 parameters
USER - Use `$splat<Purpose>` for 3+ parameters (never plain `$splat`)
USER - Align splat hashtable assignments with consistent spacing for readability
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER # Direct parameters
USER $ag = Get-DbaLogin -SqlInstance $instance -Login $loginName
USER 
USER # Splat with purpose suffix - note aligned = signs
USER $splatPrimary = @{
USER     Primary      = $TestConfig.instance3
USER     Name         = $primaryAgName
USER     ClusterType  = "None"
USER     FailoverMode = "Manual"
USER     Certificate  = "dbatoolsci_AGCert"
USER     Confirm      = $false
USER }
USER $primaryAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Unique Names Across Scopes
USER Use unique, descriptive variable names across scopes to avoid collisions. Pay particular attention to variable names in BeforeAll:
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {

USER 
USER ### Temporary Files and Cleanup
USER 
USER - Create temporary test files/directories with unique names using Get-Random
USER - Always clean up temporary resources in AfterAll or AfterEach blocks
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         # Create unique temp path for this test run
USER         $backupPath = "$($TestConfig.Temp)\$CommandName-$(Get-Random)"
USER         $null = New-Item -Path $backupPath -ItemType Directory
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         # Always clean up temp files
USER         Remove-Item -Path $backupPath -Recurse
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When performing backups" {
USER         # test code here
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Test Implementation Examples
USER 
USER ### Good Parameter Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     Context "Parameter validation" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER             $expectedParameters = $TestConfig.CommonParameters
USER             $expectedParameters += @(
USER                 "SqlInstance",
USER                 "SqlCredential",
USER                 "Database",
USER                 "EnableException"
USER             )
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Should have the expected parameters" {
USER             Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $expectedParameters -DifferenceObject $hasParameters | Should -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Good Integration Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     Context "When connecting to SQL Server" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $allResults = @()

USER                 $allResults += Get-DbaDatabase -SqlInstance $instance
USER             }
USER         }
USER

USER             $systemDbs.Count | Should -BeExactly 4
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Additional Requirements
USER 
USER ### Syntax Requirements
USER - Use $PSItem instead of $_ (except where $_ is required for compatibility)
USER - Match parameter names from original tests exactly
USER 
USER ### Must Use
USER - Static `$CommandName` parameter in param block
USER - The approach shown for parameter validation with filtering out WhatIf/Confirm
USER 
USER ### Must Not Use
USER - Dynamic command name derivation from file paths
USER - Old knownParameters validation approach
USER - Assumed parameter names - match original tests exactly
USER 
USER ## Critical Instruction
USER ALL comments must be preserved exactly as they appear in the original code, including seemingly unrelated or end-of-file comments. Even comments that appear to be development notes or temporary must be kept. This is especially important for comments related to CI/CD systems like AppVeyor.

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ````
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER IMPORTANT: Use *quadruple* backticks ```` as fences, not triple backticks!
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER Reply in English.
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

USER # Pester v5 Test Standards
USER ## Objective
USER Transform PowerShell test files to comply with Pester v5 standards for the dbatools module. Maintain all existing functionality while enforcing consistent structure and style.
USER 
USER ## Core Requirements
USER 
USER ### Required Header
USER ```powershell
USER #Requires -Module @{ ModuleName="Pester"; ModuleVersion="5.0" }
USER param(
USER     $ModuleName  = "dbatools",
USER     $CommandName = "StaticCommandName",  # Always use static command name, never derive from file
USER     $PSDefaultParameterValues = $TestConfig.Defaults
USER )
USER ```
USER The `$CommandName` must always be a static string matching the command being tested.
USER 
USER ## Test Structure
USER 
USER ### Describe Blocks
USER - Use the `$CommandName` variable for Describe block names
USER - Include appropriate tags (`-Tag UnitTests` or `-Tag IntegrationTests`)
USER - **Never use `-ForEach` parameter on any test blocks**
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     # tests here
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Context Blocks
USER - Describe specific scenarios or states
USER - Use clear, descriptive names that explain the test scenario
USER - Example: "When getting all databases", "When database is offline"
USER 
USER ### Test Code Placement
USER - All setup code goes in `BeforeAll` or `BeforeEach` blocks
USER - All cleanup code goes in `AfterAll` or `AfterEach` blocks
USER - All test assertions go in `It` blocks
USER - No loose code in `Describe` or `Context` blocks
USER - Set and remove EnableException in BeforeAll/AfterAll for integration tests
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         $filesToRemove = @()
USER         # setup code here
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues.Remove('*-Dba*:EnableException')
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         Remove-Item -Path $filesToRemove -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When getting all databases" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $results = Get-DbaDatabase
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns results" {
USER             $results | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Style Guidelines
USER 
USER ### Formatting Rules
USER - Use double quotes for strings (we're a SQL Server module)
USER - Array declarations should be on multiple lines:
USER ```powershell
USER $array = @(
USER     "Item1",
USER     "Item2",
USER     "Item3"
USER )
USER ```
USER - Skip conditions must evaluate to `$true` or `$false`, not strings
USER - Use `$global:` instead of `$script:` for test configuration variables when required for Pester v5 scoping
USER - No trailing spaces
USER - Use `$results.Status.Count` for accurate counting
USER 
USER ### Where-Object Usage
USER Avoid script blocks in Where-Object when possible:
USER ```powershell
USER # Good - direct property comparison
USER $master    = $databases | Where-Object Name -eq "master"
USER $systemDbs = $databases | Where-Object Name -in "master", "model", "msdb", "tempdb"
USER 
USER # Required - script block for Parameters.Keys or filtering
USER $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Parameter & Variable Naming Rules
USER - Use direct parameters for 1-2 parameters
USER - Use `$splat<Purpose>` for 3+ parameters (never plain `$splat`)
USER - Align splat hashtable assignments with consistent spacing for readability
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER # Direct parameters
USER $ag = Get-DbaLogin -SqlInstance $instance -Login $loginName
USER 
USER # Splat with purpose suffix - note aligned = signs
USER $splatPrimary = @{
USER     Primary      = $TestConfig.instance3
USER     Name         = $primaryAgName
USER     ClusterType  = "None"
USER     FailoverMode = "Manual"
USER     Certificate  = "dbatoolsci_AGCert"
USER     Confirm      = $false
USER }
USER $primaryAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Unique Names Across Scopes
USER Use unique, descriptive variable names across scopes to avoid collisions. Pay particular attention to variable names in BeforeAll:
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $primaryAgName = "dbatoolsci_agroup"
USER         $splatPrimary = @{
USER             Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER             Name    = $primaryAgName
USER             ...
USER         }
USER         $ag = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When adding AG replicas" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $replicaAgName = "dbatoolsci_add_replicagroup"
USER             $splatRepAg = @{
USER                 Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER                 Name    = $replicaAgName
USER                 ...
USER             }
USER             $replicaAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatRepAg
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Temporary Files and Cleanup
USER 
USER - Create temporary test files/directories with unique names using Get-Random
USER - Always clean up temporary resources in AfterAll or AfterEach blocks
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         # Create unique temp path for this test run
USER         $backupPath = "$($TestConfig.Temp)\$CommandName-$(Get-Random)"
USER         $null = New-Item -Path $backupPath -ItemType Directory
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         # Always clean up temp files
USER         Remove-Item -Path $backupPath -Recurse
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When performing backups" {
USER         # test code here
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Test Implementation Examples
USER 
USER ### Good Parameter Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     Context "Parameter validation" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER             $expectedParameters = $TestConfig.CommonParameters
USER             $expectedParameters += @(
USER                 "SqlInstance",
USER                 "SqlCredential",
USER                 "Database",
USER                 "EnableException"
USER             )
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Should have the expected parameters" {
USER             Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $expectedParameters -DifferenceObject $hasParameters | Should -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Good Integration Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     Context "When connecting to SQL Server" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $allResults = @()
USER             foreach ($instance in $TestConfig.Instances) {
USER                 $allResults += Get-DbaDatabase -SqlInstance $instance
USER             }
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns database objects with required properties" {
USER             $allResults | Should -BeOfType Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Database
USER             $allResults[0].Name | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Always includes system databases" {
USER             $systemDbs = $allResults | Where-Object Name -in "master", "model", "msdb", "tempdb"
USER             $systemDbs.Count | Should -BeExactly 4
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Additional Requirements
USER 
USER ### Syntax Requirements
USER - Use $PSItem instead of $_ (except where $_ is required for compatibility)
USER - Match parameter names from original tests exactly
USER 
USER ### Must Use
USER - Static `$CommandName` parameter in param block
USER - The approach shown for parameter validation with filtering out WhatIf/Confirm
USER 
USER ### Must Not Use
USER - Dynamic command name derivation from file paths
USER - Old knownParameters validation approach
USER - Assumed parameter names - match original tests exactly
USER 
USER ## Critical Instruction
USER ALL comments must be preserved exactly as they appear in the original code, including seemingly unrelated or end-of-file comments. Even comments that appear to be development notes or temporary must be kept. This is especially important for comments related to CI/CD systems like AppVeyor.

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ````
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER IMPORTANT: Use *quadruple* backticks ```` as fences, not triple backticks!
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER Reply in English.
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

USER Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
-------
ASSISTANT To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.

SYSTEM If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Always reply to the user in English.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Once you understand the request you MUST:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep in mind these details about the user's platform and environment:
SYSTEM - Platform: Linux-6.6.87.2-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
SYSTEM - Shell: SHELL=/bin/bash
SYSTEM - Language: English
SYSTEM - Current date: 2025-08-08

SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Reply in English.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

USER Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
-------
ASSISTANT To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Import the math package.
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
ASSISTANT 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT mathweb/flask/app.py
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT from flask import Flask
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT import math
ASSISTANT from flask import Flask
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT mathweb/flask/app.py
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT def factorial(n):
ASSISTANT     "compute factorial"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     if n == 0:
ASSISTANT         return 1
ASSISTANT     else:
ASSISTANT         return n * factorial(n-1)
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT =======

ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT mathweb/flask/app.py
ASSISTANT ```python

ASSISTANT     return str(math.factorial(n))
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
-------
USER Refactor hello() into its own file.
-------
ASSISTANT To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
ASSISTANT 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT hello.py
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT def hello():
ASSISTANT     "print a greeting"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     print("hello")
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT main.py

SYSTEM Always reply to the user in English.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Once you understand the request you MUST:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Reply in English.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

USER Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
-------
ASSISTANT To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Import the math package.
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
ASSISTANT 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT mathweb/flask/app.py
ASSISTANT ```python

USER Refactor hello() into its own file.
-------
ASSISTANT To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
ASSISTANT 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT hello.py
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT def hello():
ASSISTANT     "print a greeting"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     print("hello")

ASSISTANT To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
ASSISTANT 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
ASSISTANT

USER # Pester v5 Test Standards
USER ## Objective
USER Transform PowerShell test files to comply with Pester v5 standards for the dbatools module. Maintain all existing functionality while enforcing consistent structure and style.
USER 
USER ## Core Requirements
USER 
USER ### Required Header
USER ```powershell
USER #Requires -Module @{ ModuleName="Pester"; ModuleVersion="5.0" }
USER param(
USER     $ModuleName  = "dbatools",
USER     $CommandName = "StaticCommandName",  # Always use static command name, never derive from file
USER     $PSDefaultParameterValues = $TestConfig.Defaults
USER )
USER ```
USER The `$CommandName` must always be a static string matching the command being tested.
USER 
USER ## Test Structure
USER 
USER ### Describe Blocks
USER - Use the `$CommandName` variable for Describe block names
USER - Include appropriate tags (`-Tag UnitTests` or `-Tag IntegrationTests`)
USER - **Never use `-ForEach` parameter on any test blocks**
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     # tests here
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Context Blocks
USER - Describe specific scenarios or states
USER - Use clear, descriptive names that explain the test scenario
USER - Example: "When getting all databases", "When database is offline"
USER 
USER ### Test Code Placement
USER - All setup code goes in `BeforeAll` or `BeforeEach` blocks
USER - All cleanup code goes in `AfterAll` or `AfterEach` blocks
USER - All test assertions go in `It` blocks
USER - No loose code in `Describe` or `Context` blocks
USER - Set and remove EnableException in BeforeAll/AfterAll for integration tests
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         $filesToRemove = @()
USER         # setup code here
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues.Remove('*-Dba*:EnableException')
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         $PSDefaultParameterValues['*-Dba*:EnableException'] = $true
USER         Remove-Item -Path $filesToRemove -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When getting all databases" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $results = Get-DbaDatabase
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns results" {
USER             $results | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Style Guidelines
USER 
USER ### Formatting Rules
USER - Use double quotes for strings (we're a SQL Server module)
USER - Array declarations should be on multiple lines:
USER ```powershell
USER $array = @(
USER     "Item1",
USER     "Item2",
USER     "Item3"
USER )
USER ```
USER - Skip conditions must evaluate to `$true` or `$false`, not strings
USER - Use `$global:` instead of `$script:` for test configuration variables when required for Pester v5 scoping
USER - No trailing spaces
USER - Use `$results.Status.Count` for accurate counting
USER 
USER ### Where-Object Usage
USER Avoid script blocks in Where-Object when possible:
USER ```powershell
USER # Good - direct property comparison
USER $master    = $databases | Where-Object Name -eq "master"
USER $systemDbs = $databases | Where-Object Name -in "master", "model", "msdb", "tempdb"
USER 
USER # Required - script block for Parameters.Keys or filtering
USER $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Parameter & Variable Naming Rules
USER - Use direct parameters for 1-2 parameters
USER - Use `$splat<Purpose>` for 3+ parameters (never plain `$splat`)
USER - Align splat hashtable assignments with consistent spacing for readability
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER # Direct parameters
USER $ag = Get-DbaLogin -SqlInstance $instance -Login $loginName
USER 
USER # Splat with purpose suffix - note aligned = signs
USER $splatPrimary = @{
USER     Primary      = $TestConfig.instance3
USER     Name         = $primaryAgName
USER     ClusterType  = "None"
USER     FailoverMode = "Manual"
USER     Certificate  = "dbatoolsci_AGCert"
USER     Confirm      = $false
USER }
USER $primaryAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Unique Names Across Scopes
USER Use unique, descriptive variable names across scopes to avoid collisions. Pay particular attention to variable names in BeforeAll:
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         $primaryAgName = "dbatoolsci_agroup"
USER         $splatPrimary = @{
USER             Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER             Name    = $primaryAgName
USER             ...
USER         }
USER         $ag = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatPrimary
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When adding AG replicas" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $replicaAgName = "dbatoolsci_add_replicagroup"
USER             $splatRepAg = @{
USER                 Primary = $TestConfig.instance3
USER                 Name    = $replicaAgName
USER                 ...
USER             }
USER             $replicaAg = New-DbaAvailabilityGroup @splatRepAg
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Temporary Files and Cleanup
USER 
USER - Create temporary test files/directories with unique names using Get-Random
USER - Always clean up temporary resources in AfterAll or AfterEach blocks
USER 
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     BeforeAll {
USER         # Create unique temp path for this test run
USER         $backupPath = "$($TestConfig.Temp)\$CommandName-$(Get-Random)"
USER         $null = New-Item -Path $backupPath -ItemType Directory
USER     }
USER 
USER     AfterAll {
USER         # Always clean up temp files
USER         Remove-Item -Path $backupPath -Recurse
USER     }
USER 
USER     Context "When performing backups" {
USER         # test code here
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Test Implementation Examples
USER 
USER ### Good Parameter Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag UnitTests {
USER     Context "Parameter validation" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $hasParameters = (Get-Command $CommandName).Parameters.Values.Name | Where-Object { $PSItem -notin ('WhatIf', 'Confirm') }
USER             $expectedParameters = $TestConfig.CommonParameters
USER             $expectedParameters += @(
USER                 "SqlInstance",
USER                 "SqlCredential",
USER                 "Database",
USER                 "EnableException"
USER             )
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Should have the expected parameters" {
USER             Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $expectedParameters -DifferenceObject $hasParameters | Should -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ### Good Integration Test
USER ```powershell
USER Describe $CommandName -Tag IntegrationTests {
USER     Context "When connecting to SQL Server" {
USER         BeforeAll {
USER             $allResults = @()
USER             foreach ($instance in $TestConfig.Instances) {
USER                 $allResults += Get-DbaDatabase -SqlInstance $instance
USER             }
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Returns database objects with required properties" {
USER             $allResults | Should -BeOfType Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.Database
USER             $allResults[0].Name | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
USER         }
USER 
USER         It "Always includes system databases" {
USER             $systemDbs = $allResults | Where-Object Name -in "master", "model", "msdb", "tempdb"
USER             $systemDbs.Count | Should -BeExactly 4
USER         }
USER     }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER ## Additional Requirements
USER 
USER ### Syntax Requirements
USER - Use $PSItem instead of $_ (except where $_ is required for compatibility)
USER - Match parameter names from original tests exactly
USER 
USER ### Must Use
USER - Static `$CommandName` parameter in param block
USER - The approach shown for parameter validation with filtering out WhatIf/Confirm
USER 
USER ### Must Not Use
USER - Dynamic command name derivation from file paths
USER - Old knownParameters validation approach
USER - Assumed parameter names - match original tests exactly
USER 
USER ## Critical Instruction
USER ALL comments must be preserved exactly as they appear in the original code, including seemingly unrelated or end-of-file comments. Even comments that appear to be development notes or temporary must be kept. This is especially important for comments related to CI/CD systems like AppVeyor.

USER # Pester v4 to v5 Migration
USER 
USER You are an AI assistant created to help migrate Pester tests for the **dbatools PowerShell module** from version 4 to version 5. Analyze and update the file `/workspace/tests/Add-DbaAgListener.Tests.ps1` according to the instructions in conventions.md.
USER 
USER Command name:
USER Add-DbaAgListener
USER 
USER Parameters for this command:
USER SqlInstance
USER SqlCredential
USER AvailabilityGroup
USER Name
USER IPAddress
USER SubnetIP
USER SubnetMask
USER Port
USER Dhcp
USER Passthru
USER InputObject
USER EnableException
USER WhatIf
USER Confirm
USER 
USER Before responding, verify that your answer adheres to the specified coding and migration guidelines.
USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ````
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER IMPORTANT: Use *quadruple* backticks ```` as fences, not triple backticks!
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER Reply in English.
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

SYSTEM Reply in English.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
SYSTEM If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Always reply to the user in English.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Once you understand the request you MUST:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.

USER Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
-------
ASSISTANT To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Import the math package.
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
ASSISTANT 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

-------
ASSISTANT To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
ASSISTANT 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
ASSISTANT

SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Reply in English.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

USER Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
-------
ASSISTANT To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Import the math package.
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
ASSISTANT 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT mathweb/flask/app.py
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT from flask import Flask
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT import math
ASSISTANT from flask import Flask
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT

ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT def factorial(n):
ASSISTANT     "compute factorial"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     if n == 0:
ASSISTANT         return 1
ASSISTANT     else:
ASSISTANT         return n * factorial(n-1)
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT mathweb/flask/app.py

USER Refactor hello() into its own file.
-------
ASSISTANT To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
ASSISTANT 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT hello.py
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT def hello():
ASSISTANT     "print a greeting"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     print("hello")
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT main.py
