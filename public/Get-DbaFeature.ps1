    .SYNOPSIS
        Discovers installed SQL Server features and components across multiple servers

    .DESCRIPTION
        Executes SQL Server's built-in feature discovery report to inventory all installed SQL Server components, editions, and instances across one or more servers. This function automates the manual process of running setup.exe /Action=RunDiscovery and parsing the resulting XML report, making it perfect for compliance auditing, license tracking, and environment documentation.

        The function returns structured data showing exactly what SQL Server features are installed, which instances they belong to, their versions, editions, and configuration status. This is essential for DBAs who need to understand their SQL Server landscape without manually checking each server or running discovery reports individually.

        Inspired by Dave Mason's (@BeginTry) post at
        https://itsalljustelectrons.blogspot.be/2018/04/SQL-Server-Discovery-Report.html

        Assumptions:
        1. The sub-folder "Microsoft SQL Server" exists in [System.Environment]::GetFolderPath("ProgramFiles"),
        even if SQL was installed to a non-default path. This has been
        verified on SQL 2008R2 and SQL 2012. Further verification may be needed.
        2. The discovery report displays installed components for the version of SQL
        Server associated with setup.exe, along with installed components of all
        lesser versions of SQL Server that are installed.

    .PARAMETER ComputerName
        The target computer. If the target is not localhost, it must have PowerShell remoting enabled.

        Note that this is not the SqlInstance, but rather the ComputerName

    .PARAMETER Credential
        Allows you to login to servers using alternative credentials. To use:

        $cred = Get-Credential, then pass $cred object to the -Credential parameter.

    .PARAMETER EnableException
        By default, when something goes wrong we try to catch it, interpret it and give you a friendly warning message.
        This avoids overwhelming you with "sea of red" exceptions, but is inconvenient because it basically disables advanced scripting.
        Using this switch turns this "nice by default" feature off and enables you to catch exceptions with your own try/catch.

    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> Get-DbaFeature -ComputerName sql2017, sql2016, sql2005

        Gets all SQL Server features for all instances on sql2017, sql2016 and sql2005.

    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> Get-DbaFeature -Verbose

        Gets all SQL Server features for all instances on localhost. Outputs to screen if no instances are found.

    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> Get-DbaFeature -ComputerName sql2017 -Credential ad\sqldba

        Gets all SQL Server features for all instances on sql2017 using the ad\sqladmin credential (which has access to the Windows Server).
