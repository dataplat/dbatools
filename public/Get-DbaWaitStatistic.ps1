function Get-DbaWaitStatistic {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Retrieves SQL Server wait statistics for performance analysis and troubleshooting

    .DESCRIPTION
        Analyzes SQL Server wait statistics from sys.dm_os_wait_stats to identify performance bottlenecks and resource contention issues. This function categorizes wait types, calculates timing metrics and percentages, and provides diagnostic explanations based on Paul Randal's methodology. Use this to pinpoint whether your SQL Server is waiting on disk I/O, memory pressure, locking issues, or other resource constraints that are slowing down query performance.

        Returns:

    .PARAMETER SqlInstance
        The target SQL Server instance or instances. Server version must be SQL Server version 2005 or higher.

    .PARAMETER SqlCredential
        Login to the target instance using alternative credentials. Accepts PowerShell credentials (Get-Credential).

        Windows Authentication, SQL Server Authentication, Active Directory - Password, and Active Directory - Integrated are all supported.

        For MFA support, please use Connect-DbaInstance.

    .PARAMETER Threshold
        Threshold, in percentage of all waits on the system. Default per Paul's post is 95%.

    .PARAMETER IncludeIgnorable
        Some waits are no big deal and can be safely ignored in most circumstances. If you've got weird issues with mirroring or AGs.

    .PARAMETER EnableException
        By default, when something goes wrong we try to catch it, interpret it and give you a friendly warning message.
        This avoids overwhelming you with "sea of red" exceptions, but is inconvenient because it basically disables advanced scripting.
        Using this switch turns this "nice by default" feature off and enables you to catch exceptions with your own try/catch.

    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> Get-DbaWaitStatistic -SqlInstance sql2008, sqlserver2012

        Check wait statistics for servers sql2008 and sqlserver2012

    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> Get-DbaWaitStatistic -SqlInstance sql2008 -Threshold 98 -IncludeIgnorable

        Check wait statistics on server sql2008 for thresholds above 98% and include wait stats that are most often, but not always, ignorable

    .EXAMPLE

        Shows detailed notes, if available, from Paul's post

    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> $output = Get-DbaWaitStatistic -SqlInstance sql2008 -Threshold 100 -IncludeIgnorable | Select-Object * | ConvertTo-DbaDataTable

        Collects all Wait Statistics (including ignorable waits) on server sql2008 into a Data Table.

    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> $output = Get-DbaWaitStatistic -SqlInstance sql2008
        PS C:\> foreach ($row in ($output | Sort-Object -Unique Url)) { Start-Process ($row).Url }

        Displays the output then loads the associated sqlskills website for each result. Opens one tab per unique URL.

If the parallel threads are not given equal amounts of work to do, or one thread blocks, the waiting threads will also accumulate CXPACKET waits, which will make them aggregate a lot faster - this is a problem. One thread may have a lot more to do than the others, and so the whole query is blocked while the long-running thread completes. If this is combined with a high number of PAGEIOLATCH_XX waits, it could be large parallel table scans going on because of incorrect non-clustered indexes, or a bad query plan. If neither of these are the issue, you might want to try setting MAXDOP to 4, 2, or 1 for the offending queries (or possibly the whole instance). Make sure that if you have a NUMA system that you try setting MAXDOP to the number of cores in a single NUMA node first to see if that helps the problem. You also need to consider the MAXDOP effect on a mixed-load system. Play with the cost threshold for parallelism setting (bump it up to, say, 25) before reducing the MAXDOP of the whole instance. And don't forget Resource Governor in Enterprise Edition of  SQL Server 2008 onward that allows DOP governing for a particular group of connections to the server."

It may indicate a bottleneck at the IO subsystem level (which is a common knee-jerk response to seeing these), but why is the I/O subsystem having to service so many reads? It could be buffer pool/memory pressure (i.e. not enough memory for the workload), a sudden change in query plans causing a large parallel scan instead of a seek, plan cache bloat, or a number of other things. Don't assume the root cause is the I/O subsystem."

It could be that the client has asked for a very large amount of data or just that it's consuming it reeeeeally slowly because of poor programming - I rarely see this being a network issue. Clients often process one row at a time - called RBAR or Row-By-Agonizing-Row - instead of caching the data on the client and acknowledging to SQL Server immediately."

It commonly indicates that the I/O subsystem can't keep up with the log flush volume, but on very high-volume systems it could also be caused by internal log flush limits, that may mean you have to split your workload over multiple databases or even make your transactions a little longer to reduce log flushes. To be sure it is the I/O subsystem, use the DMV sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats to examine the I/O latency for the log file and see if it correlates to the average WRITELOG time. If WRITELOG is longer, you've got internal contention and need to shard. If not, investigate why you're creating so much transaction log."
