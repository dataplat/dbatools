function Resolve-DbaNetworkName {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Resolves network names and returns detailed network information for SQL Server connection troubleshooting and validation.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Performs comprehensive network name resolution to gather detailed connection information for SQL Server instances and computers.
        This function is essential when you need to verify connectivity, troubleshoot connection issues, or validate network configurations before connecting to SQL Server.

        Uses multiple resolution methods including DNS lookups, ICMP ping tests, and WMI/CIM queries to ensure accurate results across different network configurations.
        First tests connectivity using ICMP to identify the responding IP address, then gathers comprehensive network details through various protocols.

        Important: Remember that FQDN doesn't always match "ComputerName dot Domain" as AD intends.
        There are network setup (google "disjoint domain") where AD and DNS do not match.
        "Full computer name" (as reported by sysdm.cpl) is the only match between the two,
        and it matches the "DNSHostName"  property of the computer object stored in AD.
        This means that the notation of FQDN that matches "ComputerName dot Domain" is incorrect
        in those scenarios.
        In other words, the "suffix" of the FQDN CAN be different from the AD Domain.

        This cmdlet has been providing good results since its inception but for lack of useful
        names some doubts may arise.
        Let this clear the doubts:
        - InputName: whatever has been passed in
        - ComputerName: hostname only
        - IPAddress: IP Address
        - DNSHostName: hostname only, coming strictly from DNS (as reported from the calling computer)
        - DNSDomain: domain only, coming strictly from DNS (as reported from the calling computer)
        - Domain: domain only, coming strictly from AD (i.e. the domain the ComputerName is joined to)
        - DNSHostEntry: Fully name as returned by DNS [System.Net.Dns]::GetHostEntry
        - FQDN: "legacy" notation of ComputerName "dot" Domain (coming from AD)
        - FullComputerName: Full name as configured from within the Computer (i.e. the only secure match between AD and DNS)

        So, if you need to use something, go with FullComputerName, always, as it is the most correct in every scenario.

    .PARAMETER ComputerName
        The target SQL Server instance or instances.
        This can be the name of a computer, a SMO object, an IP address or a SQL Instance.

    .PARAMETER Credential
        Login to the target instance using alternative credentials. Accepts PowerShell credentials (Get-Credential).

        Windows Authentication, SQL Server Authentication, Active Directory - Password, and Active Directory - Integrated are all supported.

        For MFA support, please use Connect-DbaInstance.

    .PARAMETER Turbo
        Resolves without accessing the server itself. Faster but may be less accurate because it relies on DNS only,
        so it may fail spectacularly for disjoin-domain setups. Also, everyone has its own DNS (i.e. results may vary
        changing the computer where the function runs)

    .PARAMETER EnableException
        By default, when something goes wrong we try to catch it, interpret it and give you a friendly warning message.
        This avoids overwhelming you with "sea of red" exceptions, but is inconvenient because it basically disables advanced scripting.
        Using this switch turns this "nice by default" feature off and enables you to catch exceptions with your own try/catch.
