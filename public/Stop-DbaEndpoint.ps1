function Stop-DbaEndpoint {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Stops SQL Server communication endpoints like Service Broker, Database Mirroring, or custom TCP endpoints.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Stops specific or all SQL Server endpoints on target instances. Endpoints are communication channels that SQL Server uses for features like Service Broker messaging, Database Mirroring, Availability Groups, and custom applications. You might need to stop endpoints during maintenance windows, troubleshooting connectivity issues, or when decommissioning specific services. This command safely stops the endpoints without dropping them, so they can be restarted later with Start-DbaEndpoint.

    .PARAMETER SqlInstance
        The target SQL Server instance or instances.

    .PARAMETER SqlCredential
        Login to the target instance using alternative credentials. Accepts PowerShell credentials (Get-Credential).

        Windows Authentication, SQL Server Authentication, Active Directory - Password, and Active Directory - Integrated are all supported.

        For MFA support, please use Connect-DbaInstance.

    .PARAMETER Endpoint
        Specifies the names of specific endpoints to stop. Accepts multiple endpoint names as an array.
        Use this when you need to stop only certain endpoints while leaving others running, such as stopping a Service Broker endpoint for maintenance while keeping Database Mirroring endpoints active.

    .PARAMETER AllEndpoints
        Stops all endpoints on the specified SQL Server instance. Required when using SqlInstance parameter if Endpoint is not specified.
        Use this during full maintenance windows or when you need to completely disable all endpoint communication for troubleshooting network connectivity issues.

    .PARAMETER InputObject
        Accepts endpoint objects from Get-DbaEndpoint for pipeline operations. Allows filtering and processing endpoints before stopping them.
        Use this for complex scenarios where you need to filter endpoints based on their properties before stopping them.

    .PARAMETER WhatIf
        Shows what would happen if the command were to run. No actions are actually performed.

    .PARAMETER Confirm
        Prompts you for confirmation before executing any changing operations within the command.

    .PARAMETER EnableException
        By default, when something goes wrong we try to catch it, interpret it and give you a friendly warning message.
        This avoids overwhelming you with "sea of red" exceptions, but is inconvenient because it basically disables advanced scripting.
        Using this switch turns this "nice by default" feature off and enables you to catch exceptions with your own try/catch.
