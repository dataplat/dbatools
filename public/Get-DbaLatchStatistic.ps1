function Get-DbaLatchStatistic {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Retrieves latch contention statistics from SQL Server to identify performance bottlenecks

    .DESCRIPTION
        Analyzes latch wait statistics from sys.dm_os_latch_stats to help identify latch contention issues that may be causing performance problems. This function implements Paul Randal's methodology for latch troubleshooting by returning the most significant latch classes based on cumulative wait time percentage. Each result includes direct links to SQLSkills documentation explaining what each latch class means and how to resolve related issues, making it easier to diagnose and fix latch-related performance bottlenecks without manually querying system DMVs.

        Returns:
                LatchClass
                WaitSeconds
                WaitCount
                Percentage
                AverageWaitSeconds
                URL

    .PARAMETER SqlInstance
        The SQL Server instance. Server version must be SQL Server version 2005 or higher.

    .PARAMETER SqlCredential
        Login to the target instance using alternative credentials. Accepts PowerShell credentials (Get-Credential).

        Windows Authentication, SQL Server Authentication, Active Directory - Password, and Active Directory - Integrated are all supported.

        For MFA support, please use Connect-DbaInstance.

    .PARAMETER Threshold
        Threshold, in percentage of all latch stats on the system. Default per Paul's post is 95%.

    .PARAMETER EnableException
        By default, when something goes wrong we try to catch it, interpret it and give you a friendly warning message.
        This avoids overwhelming you with "sea of red" exceptions, but is inconvenient because it basically disables advanced scripting.
        Using this switch turns this "nice by default" feature off and enables you to catch exceptions with your own try/catch.

    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> Get-DbaLatchStatistic -SqlInstance sql2008, sqlserver2012

        Check latch statistics for servers sql2008 and sqlserver2012

    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> Get-DbaLatchStatistic -SqlInstance sql2008 -Threshold 98

        Check latch statistics on server sql2008 for thresholds above 98%

    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> $output = Get-DbaLatchStatistic -SqlInstance sql2008 -Threshold 100 | Select-Object * | ConvertTo-DbaDataTable

        Collects all latch statistics on server sql2008 into a Data Table.

    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> 'sql2008','sqlserver2012' | Get-DbaLatchStatistic

        Get latch statistics for servers sql2008 and sqlserver2012 via pipline

    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> $cred = Get-Credential sqladmin
        PS C:\> Get-DbaLatchStatistic -SqlInstance sql2008 -SqlCredential $cred

        Connects using sqladmin credential and returns latch statistics from sql2008

    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> $output = Get-DbaLatchStatistic -SqlInstance sql2008
        PS C:\> $output
        PS C:\> foreach ($row in ($output | Sort-Object -Unique Url)) { Start-Process ($row).Url }

        Displays the output then loads the associated sqlskills website for each result. Opens one tab per unique URL.
