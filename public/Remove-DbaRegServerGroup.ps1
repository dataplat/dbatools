function Remove-DbaRegServerGroup {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Removes server groups from SQL Server Central Management Server (CMS).

    .DESCRIPTION
        Deletes specified server groups from Central Management Server, including all nested subgroups and registered servers within those groups. This permanently removes the organizational structure you've built in CMS, so use with caution. The function works with both local registered servers and CMS-based groups, and supports piping from Get-DbaRegServerGroup for targeted removal operations.

    .PARAMETER SqlInstance
        The target SQL Server instance or instances.

    .PARAMETER SqlCredential
        Login to the target instance using alternative credentials. Accepts PowerShell credentials (Get-Credential).

        Windows Authentication, SQL Server Authentication, Active Directory - Password, and Active Directory - Integrated are all supported.

        For MFA support, please use Connect-DbaInstance.

    .PARAMETER Name
        Specifies the name of one or more server groups to remove from Central Management Server or local registered servers. Supports hierarchical paths like "HR\Development" to target subgroups within parent groups.
        Use this when you know the exact group names to delete and want to remove specific organizational structures from your CMS or local registered server configuration.

    .PARAMETER InputObject
        Accepts ServerGroup objects from Get-DbaRegServerGroup for pipeline operations. This allows you to first filter or query specific server groups, then remove them in a controlled manner.
        Use this approach when you need to perform complex filtering, review groups before deletion, or process large numbers of groups with conditional logic.

    .PARAMETER WhatIf
        Shows what would happen if the command were to run. No actions are actually performed.

    .PARAMETER Confirm
        Prompts you for confirmation before executing any changing operations within the command.

    .PARAMETER EnableException
        By default, when something goes wrong we try to catch it, interpret it and give you a friendly warning message.
        This avoids overwhelming you with "sea of red" exceptions, but is inconvenient because it basically disables advanced scripting.
        Using this switch turns this "nice by default" feature off and enables you to catch exceptions with your own try/catch.
