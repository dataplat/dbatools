function Get-DbaRandomizedType {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Lists available data types and subtypes for generating realistic test data during database masking operations

    .DESCRIPTION
        Returns all available randomizer types and subtypes that can be used with Get-DbaRandomizedValue for data masking and test data generation. These types include realistic data patterns like Person names, Address components, Finance data, Internet values, and Random data types. This command helps you discover what fake data options are available when building data masking rules or generating test datasets for non-production environments.

    .PARAMETER RandomizedType
        Filter the randomized types

    .PARAMETER RandomizedSubType
        Filter the randomized sub types

    .PARAMETER Pattern
        Get the types and sub types based on a pattern

    .PARAMETER WhatIf
        If this switch is enabled, no actions are performed but informational messages will be displayed that explain what would happen if the command were to run.

    .PARAMETER Confirm
        If this switch is enabled, you will be prompted for confirmation before executing any operations that change state.

    .PARAMETER EnableException
        By default, when something goes wrong we try to catch it, interpret it and give you a friendly warning message.
        This avoids overwhelming you with "sea of red" exceptions, but is inconvenient because it basically disables advanced scripting.
        Using this switch turns this "nice by default" feature off and enables you to catch exceptions with your own try/catch.
