    .SYNOPSIS
        Parses SQL Server trace files and extracts events for security auditing and performance analysis

    .DESCRIPTION
        Reads SQL Server trace files (.trc) using the fn_trace_gettable function and returns events as PowerShell objects for analysis. This function is essential for DBAs who need to investigate security incidents, audit database access, troubleshoot performance issues, or extract compliance data from trace files.

        The function can read both active trace files and archived trace files, including SQL Server's default trace that automatically captures configuration changes, login failures, and other critical events. You can filter results by database, login, application, event type, or use custom WHERE clauses to pinpoint specific activities.

        Common use cases include analyzing failed login attempts for security breaches, identifying slow-running queries affecting performance, tracking schema changes for change management, and extracting audit trails for compliance reporting.

    .PARAMETER SqlInstance
        The target SQL Server instance or instances.

    .PARAMETER SqlCredential
        Login to the target instance using alternative credentials. Accepts PowerShell credentials (Get-Credential).

        Windows Authentication, SQL Server Authentication, Active Directory - Password, and Active Directory - Integrated are all supported.

        For MFA support, please use Connect-DbaInstance.

    .PARAMETER Path
        Specifies the full path to the trace file (.trc) on the SQL Server instance.
        When omitted, reads from the default system trace that automatically captures configuration changes and security events.
        Use this when analyzing specific trace files created by custom traces or archived default traces.

    .PARAMETER Database
        Filters trace events to show only those affecting specific databases by name.
        Use this to focus analysis on particular databases when investigating issues or tracking changes.
        Accepts multiple database names and supports wildcards for pattern matching.

    .PARAMETER Login
        Filters trace events to show only those performed by specific SQL Server logins.
        Essential for security investigations to track activities by suspected user accounts or service accounts.
        Accepts multiple login names for comprehensive user activity analysis.

    .PARAMETER Spid
        Filters trace events to show only those from specific Session Process IDs (SPIDs).
        Useful for tracking all activities within particular database sessions or troubleshooting specific connection issues.
        Accepts multiple SPID values to monitor several concurrent sessions.

    .PARAMETER EventClass
        Filters trace events by event class numbers to focus on specific types of database activities.
        Common values include login events (14), logout events (15), SQL statements (10-12), and security audit events (102-111).
        Use this to narrow analysis to particular event types like failed logins or DDL changes.

    .PARAMETER ObjectType
        Filters trace events by the type of database object being accessed or modified.
        Common values include tables, views, stored procedures, functions, and triggers.
        Use this when investigating changes to specific types of database objects during schema modifications.

    .PARAMETER ErrorId
        Filters trace events to show only those with specific SQL Server error numbers.
        Common values include login failures (18456), permission denied (229), and deadlock victims (1205).
        Use this to focus on particular error conditions when troubleshooting recurring issues or security events.

    .PARAMETER EventSequence
        Filters trace events by their sequence number within the trace file.
        Use this to retrieve specific events when you know their exact sequence numbers from previous analysis.
        Helpful for pinpointing events that occurred at precise moments during an incident.

    .PARAMETER TextData
        Filters trace events by searching within the SQL statements or command text using pattern matching.
        Use this to find specific queries, stored procedure calls, or SQL commands that contain particular keywords.
        Supports partial text matching, making it ideal for finding all queries containing specific table names or SQL constructs.

    .PARAMETER ApplicationName
        Filters trace events by the application name that initiated the database connection.
        Use this to isolate activities from specific applications like SQL Server Management Studio, custom applications, or services.
        Supports pattern matching to group similar application names or versions together.

    .PARAMETER ObjectName
        Filters trace events by the name of the database object being accessed or modified.
        Use this to track all operations against specific tables, views, procedures, or other database objects.
        Supports pattern matching to find objects with similar naming conventions or prefixes.

    .PARAMETER Where
        Specifies a custom SQL WHERE clause for complex filtering beyond the standard parameters.
        Use this for advanced queries combining multiple conditions, date ranges, or custom logic that other parameters cannot achieve.
        Do not include the word "WHERE" - it is added automatically. Here are the available columns:

        TextData

    .PARAMETER EnableException
        By default, when something goes wrong we try to catch it, interpret it and give you a friendly warning message.
        This avoids overwhelming you with "sea of red" exceptions, but is inconvenient because it basically disables advanced scripting.
        Using this switch turns this "nice by default" feature off and enables you to catch exceptions with your own try/catch.
