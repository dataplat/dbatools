    .SYNOPSIS
        This response type is used to write Extended Events to a CSV file.

    .DESCRIPTION
        This response type is used to write Extended Events to a CSV file.

    .PARAMETER OutputFile
        Specifies the path to the output CSV file.

    .PARAMETER Overwrite
        Specifies whether any existiting file should be overwritten or not.

    .PARAMETER OutputColumn
        Specifies the list of columns to output from the events. XESmartTarget will capture in memory and write to the target table only the columns (fields or targets) that are present in this list.

        Fields and actions are matched in a case-sensitive manner.

        Expression columns are supported. Specify a column with ColumnName AS Expression to add an expression column (Example: Total AS Reads + Writes)

    .PARAMETER Event
        Specifies a list of events to be processed (with others being ignored. By default, all events are processed.

    .PARAMETER Filter
        Specifies a filter expression in the same form as you would use in the WHERE clause of a SQL query.

        Example: duration > 10000 AND cpu_time > 10000

    .PARAMETER WhatIf
        If this switch is enabled, no actions are performed but informational messages will be displayed that explain what would happen if the command were to run.

    .PARAMETER Confirm
        If this switch is enabled, you will be prompted for confirmation before executing any operations that change state.

    .PARAMETER EnableException
        By default, when something goes wrong we try to catch it, interpret it and give you a friendly warning message.
        This avoids overwhelming you with "sea of red" exceptions, but is inconvenient because it basically disables advanced scripting.
        Using this switch turns this "nice by default" feature off and enables you to catch exceptions with your own try/catch.
