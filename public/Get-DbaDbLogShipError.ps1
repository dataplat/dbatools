    .SYNOPSIS
        Retrieves log shipping error details from msdb to troubleshoot failed backup, copy, and restore operations

    .DESCRIPTION
        Queries the log shipping monitor error detail table in msdb to return comprehensive error information when log shipping operations fail.
        Identifies which specific action failed (backup on primary, copy, or restore on secondary) along with session details and error messages.
        Saves time by consolidating error details from both primary and secondary instances into a single view, so you don't have to manually query multiple system tables.
        Essential for troubleshooting log shipping failures and determining whether issues occurred during backup, file copy, or database restore phases.

    .PARAMETER SqlInstance
        The target SQL Server instance or instances. You must have sysadmin access and server version must be SQL Server version 2000 or greater.

    .PARAMETER SqlCredential
        Login to the target instance using alternative credentials. Accepts PowerShell credentials (Get-Credential).

        Windows Authentication, SQL Server Authentication, Active Directory - Password, and Active Directory - Integrated are all supported.

        For MFA support, please use Connect-DbaInstance.

    .PARAMETER Database
        Allows you to filter the results to only return the databases you're interested in. This can be one or more values separated by commas.
        This is not a wildcard and should be the exact database name. See examples for more info.

    .PARAMETER ExcludeDatabase
        Allows you to filter the results to only return the databases you're not interested in. This can be one or more values separated by commas.
        This is not a wildcard and should be the exact database name.

    .PARAMETER Action
        Filter to get the log shipping action that has occurred like Backup, Copy, Restore.
        By default all the actions are returned.

    .PARAMETER DateTimeFrom
        Filter the results based on the date starting from datetime X

    .PARAMETER DateTimeTo
        Filter the results based on the date ending with datetime X

    .PARAMETER Primary
        Allows to filter the results to only return values that apply to the primary instance.

    .PARAMETER Secondary
        Allows to filter the results to only return values that apply to the secondary instance.

    .PARAMETER EnableException
        By default, when something goes wrong we try to catch it, interpret it and give you a friendly warning message.
        This avoids overwhelming you with "sea of red" exceptions, but is inconvenient because it basically disables advanced scripting.
        Using this switch turns this "nice by default" feature off and enables you to catch exceptions with your own try/catch.

    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> Get-DbaDbLogShipError -SqlInstance sql1

        Get all the log shipping errors that occurred

    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> Get-DbaDbLogShipError -SqlInstance sql1 -Action Backup

        Get the errors that have something to do with the backup of the databases

    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> Get-DbaDbLogShipError -SqlInstance sql1 -Secondary

        Get the errors that occurred on the secondary instance.
        This will return the copy of the restore actions because those only occur on the secondary instance

    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> Get-DbaDbLogShipError -SqlInstance sql1 -DateTimeFrom "01/05/2018"

        Get the errors that have occurred from "01/05/2018". This can also be of format "yyyy-MM-dd"

    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> Get-DbaDbLogShipError -SqlInstance sql1 -Secondary -DateTimeFrom "01/05/2018" -DateTimeTo "2018-01-07"

        Get the errors that have occurred between "01/05/2018" and "01/07/2018".
        See that is doesn't matter how the date is represented.
