    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Creates a comprehensive diagnostic package for troubleshooting dbatools module issues and bugs.

    .DESCRIPTION
        This function creates an extensive diagnostic package specifically designed to help the dbatools team troubleshoot module-related issues, bugs, or unexpected behavior. When you encounter problems with dbatools commands or need to submit a bug report, this package provides all the environmental and runtime information needed for effective debugging.

        The resulting compressed file contains comprehensive system and PowerShell environment details that are essential for reproducing and diagnosing issues. This saves you from manually collecting multiple pieces of information and ensures nothing important gets missed when reporting problems.

        The package includes:
        - Operating system and hardware information (CPU, RAM, OS version)
        - PowerShell and .NET framework versions and loaded modules
        - Your PowerShell command history from the current session
        - dbatools internal message and error logs
        - Complete console buffer contents (everything currently visible in your PowerShell window)
        - Loaded assemblies and their versions
        - Any additional variables you specify

        The output file is automatically created on your desktop (or home directory if desktop doesn't exist) as a timestamped ZIP archive. Always start a fresh PowerShell session and reproduce the minimal steps to trigger your issue before running this command - this keeps the diagnostic data focused and avoids including unrelated information or sensitive data from your session history.

    .PARAMETER Path
        The folder where to place the output xml in.

    .PARAMETER Variables
        Name of additional variables to attach.
        This allows you to add the content of variables to the support package, if you believe them to be relevant to the case.

    .PARAMETER PassThru
        Returns file object that was created during execution.

    .PARAMETER WhatIf
        If this switch is enabled, no actions are performed but informational messages will be displayed that explain what would happen if the command were to run.

    .PARAMETER Confirm
        If this switch is enabled, you will be prompted for confirmation before executing any operations that change state.

    .PARAMETER EnableException
        By default, when something goes wrong we try to catch it, interpret it and give you a friendly warning message.
        This avoids overwhelming you with "sea of red" exceptions, but is inconvenient because it basically disables advanced scripting.
        Using this switch turns this "nice by default" feature off and enables you to catch exceptions with your own try/catch.

Please submit this file to the team, to help with troubleshooting whatever issue you encountered. Be aware that this package contains a lot of information including your input history in the console. Please make sure no sensitive data (such as passwords) can be caught this way.
Ideally start a new console, perform the minimal steps required to reproduce the issue, then run this command. This will make it easier for us to troubleshoot and you won't be sending us the keys to your castle.
