function Remove-DbaAgentJob {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Removes SQL Server Agent jobs from one or more instances with options to preserve history and schedules.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Removes SQL Server Agent jobs from the target instances using the sp_delete_job system stored procedure. By default, both job history and unused schedules are deleted along with the job itself. You can optionally preserve job execution history for compliance or troubleshooting purposes, and keep unused schedules that might be reused for other jobs. This function is commonly used when decommissioning applications, cleaning up test environments, or removing obsolete maintenance jobs during server consolidation projects.

    .PARAMETER SqlInstance
        The target SQL Server instance or instances. This can be a collection and receive pipeline input to allow the function to be executed against multiple SQL Server instances.

    .PARAMETER SqlCredential
        Login to the target instance using alternative credentials. Accepts PowerShell credentials (Get-Credential).

        Windows Authentication, SQL Server Authentication, Active Directory - Password, and Active Directory - Integrated are all supported.

        For MFA support, please use Connect-DbaInstance.

    .PARAMETER Job
        The name of the job. Can be null if the the job id is being used.

    .PARAMETER KeepHistory
        Specifies to keep the history for the job. By default history is deleted.

    .PARAMETER KeepUnusedSchedule
        Specifies to keep the schedules attached to this job if they are not attached to any other job.
        By default the unused schedule is deleted.

    .PARAMETER InputObject
        Accepts piped input from Get-DbaAgentJob

    .PARAMETER WhatIf
        Shows what would happen if the command were to run. No actions are actually performed.

    .PARAMETER Confirm
        Prompts you for confirmation before executing any changing operations within the command.

    .PARAMETER EnableException
        By default, when something goes wrong we try to catch it, interpret it and give you a friendly warning message.
        This avoids overwhelming you with "sea of red" exceptions, but is inconvenient because it basically disables advanced scripting.
        Using this switch turns this "nice by default" feature off and enables you to catch exceptions with your own try/catch.

    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> Remove-DbaAgentJob -SqlInstance sql1 -Job Job1

        Removes the job from the instance with the name Job1

    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> GetDbaAgentJob -SqlInstance sql1 -Job Job1 | Remove-DbaAgentJob -KeepHistory

        Removes the job but keeps the history

    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> Remove-DbaAgentJob -SqlInstance sql1 -Job Job1 -KeepUnusedSchedule

        Removes the job but keeps the unused schedules

    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> Remove-DbaAgentJob -SqlInstance sql1, sql2, sql3 -Job Job1

        Removes the job from multiple servers
