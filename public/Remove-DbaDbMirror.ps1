function Remove-DbaDbMirror {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Breaks database mirroring partnerships and stops mirroring sessions

    .DESCRIPTION
        Terminates database mirroring sessions by breaking the partnership between principal and mirror databases. This command stops the mirroring relationship completely, which is useful when decommissioning mirrors, performing maintenance that requires breaking the partnership, or during disaster recovery scenarios where you need to bring a database online independently.

        Important: This function only breaks the mirroring partnership - it does not automatically recover databases that are left in a "Restoring" state. You'll need to manually restore those databases with RECOVERY to make them accessible for normal operations.

    .PARAMETER SqlInstance
        The target SQL Server instance or instances. This can be a collection and receive pipeline input to allow the function
        to be executed against multiple SQL Server instances.

    .PARAMETER SqlCredential
        Login to the target instance using alternative credentials. Accepts PowerShell credentials (Get-Credential).

        Windows Authentication, SQL Server Authentication, Active Directory - Password, and Active Directory - Integrated are all supported.

        For MFA support, please use Connect-DbaInstance.

    .PARAMETER Database
        The target database.

    .PARAMETER InputObject
        Allows piping from Get-DbaDatabase.

    .PARAMETER WhatIf
        Shows what would happen if the command were to run. No actions are actually performed.

    .PARAMETER Confirm
        Prompts you for confirmation before executing any changing operations within the command.

    .PARAMETER EnableException
        By default, when something goes wrong we try to catch it, interpret it and give you a friendly warning message.
        This avoids overwhelming you with "sea of red" exceptions, but is inconvenient because it basically disables advanced scripting.
        Using this switch turns this "nice by default" feature off and enables you to catch exceptions with your own try/catch.
