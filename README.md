# dbatools
This module is a SQL Server DBA's best friend. 

The dbatools project initially started out as Start-SqlMigration.ps1, but has now grown into a collection of various commands that help automate DBA tasks and encourage best practices.

See the [getting started](https://dbatools.io/getting-started) page on [dbatools.io](https://dbatools.io) for more information.
