------

-- This can help you determine the exact core counts used by SQL Server and whether HT is enabled or not
-- It can also help you confirm your SQL Server licensing model
-- Be on the lookout for this message "using 40 logical processors based on SQL Server licensing" 
-- (when you have more than 40 logical cores) which means grandfathered Server/CAL licensing
-- This query will return no results if your error log has been recycled since the instance was last started

-- max server memory (MB) (set to an appropriate value, not the default)
-- optimize for ad hoc workloads (should be 1)

-- The behavior of TF 1117, 1118 are enabled for tempdb in SQL Server 2016 by default
-- SQL 2016 – It Just Runs Faster: -T1117 and -T1118 changes for TEMPDB and user databases

------

-- Gives you some basic information about your SQL Server Agent jobs, who owns them and how they are configured
-- Look for Agent jobs that are not owned by sa
-- Look for jobs that have a notify_email_operator_id set to 0 (meaning no operator)

-- Are your backup sizes and times changing over time?
-- Are you using backup compression?
-- Are you using backup checksums?
-- Are you doing copy_only backups?
-- Are you doing encrypted backups?
-- Have you done any backup tuning with striped backups, or changing the parameters of the backup command?
